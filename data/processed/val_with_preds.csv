"I've been a reluctant viewer of star wars since 1999. The later offerings have been a cash grab spectacle of video game choreography, laser light shows (pew pew), and nonsensical space magic - with a nasty Tootsie roll center of needless nostalgia. The Mandolorian started of fresh. I loved season 1... But it lost me by the end of season 2.  I saw Andor on the front page of Disney+ for several months and had been avoiding it as another show that would end up frustrating me. Holy smokes was I wrong. By the second episode, I was hooked. It's a small scale setting... But it goes deep, and it is a thing of beauty. I have loved every minute of watching this show.  Andor has built characters and relationships that I care about. I know what they're feeling by how they're acting (not what they're telling another character). There is actual tension, pain, suffering, and joy. I understand what is the problem and who the bad guys are by how they're acting and influencing the main characters.... Not because they have a red stick.  The characters have actual problems and the show stays within it's own lore. The space ships need time to go into hyperspace mode. The storm troopers actual look like an army.. Not just canon fodder... The guns  Star wars canon starts over. 1) Andor, 2) Rogue One, 3) OT.... And maybe Mandolorian if they can stop with the callbacks. Burn everything else. It never happened.",10,positive,positive
"Its Star Wars, damn right! It has the atmosphere, the looks, the vibe, the cinematography, it has everything that Star Wars brought us throughout history.  Welcome back, SW.",3,negative,positive
"I don't know if this was based off the cartoon or the original tv show (the remade movie with Huston and Julia was similar to the TV show. I know nothing about the cartoon except seeing some ads for it a few times. But the Gomez in Wednesday looks similar to the Gomez in the cartoon. So when I make any comparisons it will be based on the tv show and the Huston/Julia version compared to Wednesday characters.  First, Gomez, horrible casting except he looks like the cartoon. In the TV show and the Huston/Julia movie you could feel chemistry between them. Huston gave a dark, somber version of Morticia which was similar to the original. Julia was the suave and lovestruck Gomez. Gomez is OK in most of his roles but a suave and deadly with a sword type he is not. Zeta Jones just doesn't have what it takes to be a Morticia. She was an OK actress when she was in her prime and IMO her looks carried the lackluster acting. To be honest both are too old for the roles.  Wednesday did a good job of being the dark and cynical Wednesday. You could picture her as the younger version from the TV show. When she went to the dance and actually danced I thought that is out of character and then I remembered the episode in the original where she was showing off the latest dance craze.  Uncle Fester was a fairly decent reproduction of the original. Pugsley I was not impressed with. Lurch...Well what can you say about a character that mainly walks around and groan. While it was funny in the original it just doesn't seem like Lurch. I wonder if we will be seeing Cousin It and Grandmama in future episodes. My only question was other than being weird what was the justification for the Addams going to Nevermore? Supposedly Thornhill was the ""first"" normie at the school. They have vampires, werewolves, sirens, gorgons, shapeshifters and other things but I don't believe they have ever said what the Addams are.  Anyway, if you liked the original then Wednesday is a good reproduction if you overlook Morticia and Gomez. Now if this was based on the cartoon and that is how they are like that then forget this whole ramble :) But for some reason I picture the Gomez cartoon character as more like a weasley Igor type.",10,positive,positive
"I honestly liked Wednesday, but it was way too overhyped to me, the actors are amazing and the setting is beautifully scary, but the story line isn't all that much, I felt like I was watching it for the graphics and not the story itself </3. Things like Nevermore was built so well, Jenna's outfit and makeup was amazing, the other characters designs were lovely but I say they could have given more to the stories of them, give them character development, give the movie more then just ""Wednesday tries to find the bad guy and no one believes in her"" cliche, I did enjoy the show when I did watch it so in not throwing it any shade :)",8,positive,positive
The Mandalorian is the best thing about Star Wars in the last 10 years. My favorite TV show at the moment. Mando is such a good main character.,6,neutral,positive
Has the feel of the books. This going to be a mst watch for me as soon as the new episodes come out. Alan Ritchson is the living embodiment of Jack Reacher. If you like the book series you will love the series.,8,positive,positive
"Quite frankly the show is worth 10 simply for every line of comedy gold uttered by Dandelion, regardless of the great stuntwork, character building, story and intrigue.",6,neutral,positive
"First, I haven't read the books so I can't comment there. This is entertaining and I would watch 2 or 3 episodes at a time so 10 stars for ""watchability"" and the casting of Alan Ritchson as Reacher. My thing about ""flaws"" is that this series could have been at least one episode shorter without filler minutes and some faster story telling by the writers (hey, other streaming series are much worse!) Also, it was a bit formulaic and thus predictable at times (-1 star). So that's 10-1-1=8 stars. Season 2 update: I still enjoy the series. But Season 2 easily could have been 4 episodes. Wish whoever cast Season 2 had found a different villain than Robert Patrick who is cast so often in these roles. I would have preferred someone less well known And, even more than Season 1, the last episode was way to formulaic, especially the climatic action scene (so, -1 more star) Down to 7 stars.",10,positive,positive
"The Actors are amazing and well fitted, writers doing an amazing job and the rest of producer team same thing. Theres no person in this world that would fit that well as Thomas Shelby. Cillian Murphy was born to this Roll. The british accent just makes this better. 10/10",6,neutral,positive
"I cannot describe how in love I am with the whole story line, concept and actors. This is hands down one of the best shows I have watched in a long time and I really need more seasons. It's a totally new and fresh idea, which is literally suitable for so many age ranges to watch - I binged the whole show in 2 days! Best show on Netflix at the moment and definitely will be for a long time! It's like the movie but a million times better, with new in depth characters and stories! I really do hope they renew it for a new season and soon because I cannot wait!! A must watch for anyone wanting something new to binge!",7,neutral,positive
Boring... Too boring to stand... You are not curious about the forthcoming events because plot is ordinary.,9,positive,positive
"Im not kidding, this show has made me feel things real life has never made me feel??! I cried from anger to sadness to joy! It truly is beautiful to see how strong women are (even if it is truly fictional), it is a must watch FOR SURE.",8,positive,positive
"Season One's mixture of Commando, Sherlock Holmes, the Dukes of Hazzard & the 'A' Team was likeable throwback fun with engaging characters and a compelling, to a degree, story. You know the sort of thing: a smart tough hero saves a small town which inexplicably exists virtually outside of any Federal or State law, unlocks a bigger conspiracy, and he makes friends and allies along the way. Season Two felt rushed, cheaper and obvious to the point of boring. As well as a lot of padding and a plot reveal early on Reacher's indestructible and smarmy scooby gang, endlessly quipping no matter what the situation and with their annoying flashbacks will have you rooting for the bad guys or struggling to finish it. Something is definitely lost in tone. So one good and one bad season so far gives this an overall mediocre score. Reacher is a great character. Let's hope, if there's a season three, they improve the show.",10,positive,positive
"2nd season syndrome. Where a tv show fails to carry on the same quality of storytelling as season 1. I'm seeing far too many of these shows and unfortunately Reacher is one of them.  I'm going to be honest. The days of me liking Lee Child's books are over. I couldn't even get past chapter 1 of the last book I got. I did however like season 1 of Reacher. It felt like a Lee Child book. The story and supporting cast for that story were great. It held my interest far more than season 2.  Season 2 is another matter. Nothing about this is great, I haven't finished the season yet. I probably will since I've made it through most of it. I don't like the supporting cast. They keep insisting on bringing. Neagley back. She was the only supporting character who I didn't like in season 1, so of course she is there in season 2 and I see season 3 as well. Reacher in the books didn't have this backup and I don't think she should be here either. It defeats the purpose of the Reacher character. The story for season 2 is meh.  I may give season 3 a chance but I find when a show has 2nd season syndrome they normally don't improve again.",5,neutral,positive
If you do not pay attention you might get lost in the chronology of the events. A lot of people did not get this and found it confusing for sure. I think they should have clarified it. It was very easy to do everything they needed was to put a sign saying X time ago and that's it. Other than that this show has everything to become great!,7,neutral,positive
"I am very pleased with this version of Reacher. The back story gave lots of info on who he was and why. While the movies we very good, I would have loved him in the original. While the professional critic may have an opinion I did not agree with them. I can't wait for the next installment.  I binged the first season and hope not to wait forever for the next!",7,neutral,positive
"Mike White, please don't make any more White Lotus seasons. The third one was pathetic and it felt like you're just milking a cow which is not there anymore. First two seasons were amaaazing but this one was so horrible.  Story - nope Twists or shocks - nil Captivation - nada  Mike White must go back and watch the previous seasons and see the complexities and storytelling that was captured in the last two seasons. The story was the main appeal and pull. Whereas in the third season, you can't just throw a lady with a funny accent (totally copied from Catherine O'Hara in Schitt's Creek) or a woman talking about Mercury retrograde and expect that to be of any entertainment value.  It's not just the intro that was ruined in the third season, it was the series that got ruined for me.",3,negative,positive
"I mean what happened?  Season 2 completly sucks.  Season 1 was ok even good at times, was expecting you would improve as the story goes deeper. However to my surprise everything is getting worse not better. The only constant thing is Geralt(Henry) who is doing a fine job but the rest is dissapointing.",9,positive,positive
"This is a fun watch, it's definitely a cool addition to what we know from the movies. The casting of Wednesday is a very good fit. The parents, especially the father not so much. But they're not main characters so that's forgivable.  It's also shot very nicely, quality production here.  The thing that really stands out is that some writers/producers really did their best to load a lot of moments with a PC political agenda. It's really distracting from the storyline and kind of undermines the character arcs.  You really can feel the board-room meeting kindo of influence in this script. But hey it's what we can expect from Netflix nowadays.  It would be nice if they didn't, to make this truly a timeless series, but too bad.  If it didn't have this I would give this an 8, but I can only give it 5 or 6 because it's distracting from the show.",9,positive,positive
I watched 8 episodes and I have enjoyed every one so far. I been waiting since Disney bought the franchise for them to produce something watchable and this is it. Let's hope they make more likes this instead of the rubbish in the cinemas.,6,neutral,positive
"FIRST SEASON : 6,4/10  I don't know how to rate this.  Every actor here is nearly excellent or excellent. The script is clever, the subtlety is brilliant. This is an accurate depiction of Western civilization's decay. 6 stars for these qualities.  But, it's too cynical.  How can you like a tv series when every character here is kinda disgusting? Belinda was a nice character, Armond was somewhat likeable, but every other character here made me sick. Furthermore, the end is anti-climactic and not cathartic. I get it, there is no salvation, but come on, give me someting to enjoy, even mildly.  I like sad and depressing movies, but this is a new height, disguised as a comedy.  The actors were excellent. But you can't enjoy a movie or a series when almost every character is rotten to the core.  SECOND SEASON : 7,2/10  Second season is improved. Not the cringefest we watched before, these are more well written characters and more likeable. I could identify, to a certain extent, with some of them and i could watch the obnoxious/unlikeable rest of them without feeling sick or disgusted, like i did in the first season.  Furthermore, there was a smooth character development. Everything seemed natural, nothing felt forced nor fake.  Acting is still great, this was never a problem with White Lotus. Every actor here did a great job.  I can't rate it higher because it was not exciting. A comedy/drama, interesting and enjoyable but nothing more, not that vitriolic or brilliant. Ending was much better than the last season's. Whereas it was still not satisfying, i appreciated it because it was partially unpredictable, kinda clever and like every other aspect of this season, it felt natural.",8,positive,positive
"One of the things I've loved about The White Lotus is how each season feels like its own unique little universe. Different locations, new characters, and totally fresh vibes-yet it all still somehow feels like part of the same twisted, satirical world. That's no easy feat, and Mike White is a revolutionary visionary.  Season 3 definitely had its strengths-stunning visuals, great performances, and that signature undercurrent of tension. But compared to the first two seasons, this one felt a little slower and more drawn out. The pacing made it easier to see where things were going, and by the time the death was revealed, I had already guessed it. It just didn't have that jaw-dropping shock that made the endings of Seasons 1 and 2 so unforgettable.  That said, I still enjoyed the ride and have been pretty enthralled with all of the casts revelations in press following the season. Even a slower season of White Lotus is better than most shows out there, and I appreciate how each installment tries to do something different. Hoping the next season keeps evolving-and brings back a bit of that unpredictability that made the earlier seasons so thrilling.",10,positive,positive
Nobody can defeat Thomas shelby can't wait for new season.,5,neutral,positive
I love Peaky Blinders and the Acting of Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy everyone is good in whole show the theme music is fabulous.,9,positive,positive
"The White Lotus is back, and the Season 3 premiere is an absolute masterpiece! Set in breathtaking Thailand, the episode immediately pulls you in with its signature mix of dark humor, sharp social satire, and an undercurrent of mystery that keeps you on edge. The new cast is phenomenal-Parker Posey and Jason Isaacs are scene-stealers, but every actor delivers compelling, layered performances. The writing is razor-sharp, balancing biting commentary with moments of pure brilliance. The story is already unfolding with intrigue, unexpected twists, and the kind of tension that makes this show so addictive. Mike White has done it again-this season is going to be unforgettable!",10,positive,positive
"Old school type of clothes, with razor caps, the classic Peaky Blinder gadget, just love the fashion. Great and serious actors and swinging/leading theme song that always gets you into a good mood. By the order of the Peaky fo**in Blinders! ????",10,positive,positive
"I loved Jennifer Coolidge in both seasons, she's an awesome actress. Some of the characters in season 2 I found annoying. Though an Interesting show The ending was unfavorable as always the death of someone. They blew it with the ending of season 2 as the person who lost there life, in the way they did was to say very unrealistic of anyone with a brain. Hopefully season 3 will clarify the ending of season 2, giving watchers some closure and Justice for crimes committed in season 2. I don't enjoy loose ends. I am not sure I will watch a season 3. I will watch at least the first episode and may a choice.",10,positive,positive
"What can you say, but WOW! Wow, wow, wow!!! To be completely honest, I love Star Wars. Be it movies, series, comics, or what have you. I've even tolerated Jar Jar Binks, for crying out loud! But this. Andor. W-O-W. I have not been this enthralled with ANY Star Wars for years!!! Story, characters, buildup, suspense, action, everything! With this series, moreover, Diego Luna has risen to galactic stardom!  From the first episode, it is crystal clear that this is something different. The writers have taken their time (not too short, not too long), to appropriately build characters. Even those that initially seem inconsequential are properly built, and later on it makes total sense. If you were to watch single episodes, it would seem like a mashup of different unrelated stories. But every single story, every thread, is spun perfectly, creating a web of intrigues that explains so much in the entire Star Wars universe. As some other reviews mention, CGI and explosions are part of the background, they are not the story. Visually, this is a masterpiece. As for storytelling, one of the best examples seen in recent cinematic history.  Man... I think I'm gonna binge watch it again right now!!!",9,positive,positive
"Let me say one thing: if you had come to me a decade ago and said that Kevin Costner's flagging career would be revived thanks to his role in a modern day western, I would probably have laughed and called you crazy.  Yet it happened. Costner's John Dutton will surely go down in the annals of TV history as one of the best characters ever.  Costner played Dutton perfectly: a doting father, a ruthless ranch owner and a man who is no stranger to violence. Unforgettable.  With ""Yellowstone, Taylor Sheridan has done something quite difficult: he made us care immensely about a bunch of characters of dubious moral standing.  For example, Kelly Reilly's Beth Dutton was, for the most part, a horrible person, yet you cared about what happened for her, cheered on her successes and commiserated her failures, even when said successes might have been on the wrong side of what's right.  That's because Reilly is a brilliant actress, and because she was given top-notch material to work with.  Cole Hauser, Luke Grimes, Kelsey Asbille, Wes Bentley...all brilliant.  Sheridan is a genius.  What a show. We won't see it's like again, that's for sure.",9,positive,positive
I enjoyed season one and two but the story line for season 3 just seems redundant so far. I have to purchase the series in order to watch so I think I'll spend my streaming money somewhere else!,6,neutral,positive
"Final episode season 3, what the hell....  Words fail me, how can a show go from epic cinema on ya TV to epic fail on ya TV.  Had to mark it down from 10 to 7 just for the last 3 episodes, seriously what are the writers smoking?  Not sure I'll be back for S4. Quite sad really how shows just go way beyond their original story-line into a fantasy world no self respecting cowboy would be.",6,neutral,positive
I dig the vibe. Maybe Mando and the wee one will adventure together like Ahsoka and the Huttlet in CW or Lone Wolf and Cub style. Neato!,10,positive,positive
"So the first two seasons weren't great but also not an unwatchable level of stupidity as a season 3.  Where to start... Story that doesn't make any sense, stupid and totally incompetent decisions about, well... everything. Plot holes big enough to swallow a Star Destroyer. Mandalorians, that brave, smart, clever warriors acting like a bunch of totally incompetent amateurs Unlikable/boring characters. Dialogues that seem to be written by a not very smart 8 years old kid...  At this point I really don't care about any of them. They can all die in a next episode and Il be like ""finally, something interesting is happening."" Conclusion, SW is a dead franchise and Mando is just another, no brain, but at the same time also not entertaining generic show that has begun as something interesting, something that could potentially grow to be a really good and quality entertainment but failed miserably.  Dear Disney, you totally destroyed SW. Totally.",10,positive,positive
"A simplistic story is the base for a great show. The production value is amazing! While the pace of the show is slow at first, it is necessary to set up the solitary life of a bounty hunter. It is this loneliness that makes the relationships he builds so much more meaningful. A worthy installment to Star Wars cannon.",6,neutral,positive
"I was there at the beginning, as an eight year old in 1977 dreaming of being Luke Skywalker. Rogue One is the best Star Wars film to come out in the last 30 years, and Andor is the best TV series.  Don't get me wrong, I love love love The Mandolorian and The Book of Boba Fett kicks ass, but Andor is by far my favorite.  Dramatic and heartfelt, it feels like a real world, not some cartoon cutout like the Jar Jar prequels, or the rushed money grab of episodes 7 to 9.  I get that the SW universe was originally meant for the bright eyed child in all of us, but it's nice to see finally that some people take this world seriously.  The Bad Batch is my second favorite after this.",10,positive,positive
"Really well acted, compelling story, great sets and locations, feels like a part of Star Wars in a way that Boba Fett never managed to pull off. Between this and Mandlorian - if Mado was Return of the Jedi (Star Ward with puppets) Andor is Empire Strikes Back.  Stella now a particularly good character. I'm really enjoying this series - more than I expected to - and really don't want it to finish. The attention to detail in the locations, costumes and sets is as impressive as everything else. With the right writing, I could see this running for quite a while and could become the primary Star Wars vehicle.",10,positive,positive
This is very enjoyable series. I hope this series has a long run.,8,positive,positive
Too over the top. Too Hollywood. Not entertaining in the least.,9,positive,positive
"In my opinion one of the greatest British series ever made. Love the drama, the cast, director also did great job, and amazing soundtrack adds to the quality of the show. Highly recommend!",10,positive,positive
"The trailer and the hype convinced us, only to be disappoined within the 1st episode. Not reading the books or playing the game, we entered with little knowledge and tried not to compare it to Game of Thrones.  The result is an astonishingly bad show. Maybe it's because we don't know the story, but the show itself feels incoherent and unhinged. The time line is confusing, but worst of all, the dialogue is cringe worthy. Even decent actors struggle to make scenes look convincing, and the only decent part are the scarce but well choreographed sword fights and Henry Cavill who is pretty charismatic.  We haven't finished the show yet, so who knows. But we couldn't watch further after the episode that resembles Beauty & the Beast, without writing this review.",6,neutral,positive
"Sadly I think the Mandalorian is overrated. The plot of the show is, yes I'll say it, simply weak. Why would a bounty hunter care for this ""child""-creature anyway? Or help out other people in need. Bounty hunters kill for a living, his motivation never is explained.  Yes, it looks good, yes it sounds VERY good, it's not garbage like the last three disney-crap-movies and it's fun to watch. But it isn't great . There are great shows out there, like Breaking Bad, Mr. Robot or Game Of Thrones, but The Mandalorian is nowhere close to those shows that set up the bar.  Honestly, if the show wasn't using the Star Wars universe, no one would care for it, because it isn't good enough on its own.  It still is the second best attempt to bring life into the the Star Wars-universe by Disney, the very best was Rogue One.  I rate The Mandalorian 7 stars, because the music is great and the show is, besides its weak plot, still fun to watch.",7,neutral,positive
"With out spoiling anything, this is the best show on Disney plus and the best thing since rogue one. Dave filoni and Jon favreou are amazing behind the scenes and the attention to detail and the Easter eggs wow. I mean they bring in things from the dang Christmas special that everyone hated and made me want to like that terrible thing haha. Beautifully done. Now if they would just get rid of Kennedy and put Dave filloni in charge we might get great movies again",10,positive,positive
"I was unlucky and got sick, but lucky enough that it happened when Wednesday was released. Made it all more bearable and I watched the entire series with great pleasure. I loved the atmosphere, the characters and also the story.  It's kind of interesting how they made a date in a crypt turn romantic. This will be exactly how all girls will want to celebrate Valentine's Day 2023.  Also, I want to give the biggest round of applause to the costume creator, I want Wednesday's entire wardrobe. So crazy that I seriously ordered a black/white checkered knit dress! Love it!!  I give it a 10*. Though the ending was quite predictable, but who cares..  See it!",1,negative,positive
Complex and nuanced characters. Surprising incidents. Unusual setting. Both action and drama. What more do you want in a TV series? I bought the season for $20 from iTunes and am glad I did.,2,negative,positive
"I watched the first season and was impressed not only by the acting which was worthy of every award going, but the way it stuck to the story. Given the time period when it was written it seemed in point today with the invasion of the religion of peace and its keen disrespect for women and gay people. To be honest is not hard to draw comparisons.  Now I'm into season 2, none of which was penned by the original author, and by the second episode, we are already into a gay rights romp. The point about the unfairness and downright ugliness this new world visits upon gay people is made very clear in the first season. Along with all women are victims and all men are B'stards.  The first season can be forgiven for all of this because at the time of writing in 1985, today's full on ""in your face"" enforced respect for gay people didn't exist so the story served to show how ugly humanity could become if pushed in the wrong direction.  Now a whole episode has been devoted to gay rights I have to wonder what is next. Above and beyond all of that. Season 2 seems to excellently promote the same morbid atmosphere that season one had. Hopefully today's politics will stay out of the rest of it and it will be just as good.  On a footnote. For gay people who feel its a good idea to wave welcome banners at a particular ideology this show offers insight into what you could be welcoming.",8,positive,positive
Seasons 1-3 are great with an interesting plot and action. 4 is just lame. There are a lot of silly useless side characters that need to just die off. It's obvious this show needs to end soon but they're just dragging it out. As others have said it feels like they've abandoned the series for 1883 and trying to hook people on buying another streaming service.  Edit: Beth ruining this show. She's unlikable in every way and so over the top it's ridiculous. No one would listen to a person that insane. I've gotten to the point I just hope someone kills her off.,9,positive,positive
"Maybe its not for everyone. But i know for a fact that a certain kind of people will love that show. It has depth, humor and its kind of sexy.  I enjoyed the first two episodes a lot. Can't wait for more.",8,positive,positive
"I watched the entire first season before offering a review. While it has it's pros and cons, ""Wednesday"" is a far cry from what creator Charles Addams had in mind.  On the pro side, much of the casting was well thought, including Ortega (who I was initially skeptical of). Yes, she's a few years older than her character, but that's pretty common in film and television. Fred Armisen as Uncle Fester and Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia were great additions (Fred needs to be in more episodes in season 2). Other stand-outs were Gwendolyn Christie, Riki Lindhome, and ""second Wednesday"" herself Christina Ricci. But props to Emma Myers (as roommate and budding werewolf Enid) who was a bright spot in a generally dreary environment.  On the con side, I'm sorry but prolific character actor Luis Guzman was miscast as Gomez. Guzman has the physical shape of Charles Addams concept for Gomez (not tall like Raul Julia or John Astin), but he simply is not dashing or effusive and his dialog is often hard to understand. And the Pugsley and Lurch roles were practically non-existent.  Also on the con side is making ""Wednesday"" a YA-focused show. As such, it was filled with forgettable second-tier characters with little tension or backstories. And the two potential suitors for Wednesday were interchangeable with other ""teen"" actors and were immiedtaly forgettable.  A big question is why Tim Burton decided to create a whole world of ""outsiders"" around the Addamses. The genius of the original TV show and 1990's films was how the Addams family, while outwardly odd, seemed more loving and normal than the so-called ""normal"" characters - that was the point. Giving each member of the Addams clan ""powers"" (except Gomez and Pugsley, as far as we know) defeats the whole purpose of Charles Addams creations. Burton compounds the problem of putting them in a world of werewolves (""furs""), vampires (""fangs""), sirens, Gorgons (medusas), hydes (no jekylls?), shape-shifters, and faceless students who don't say anything. Most of these add little to the show (there are some notable exceptions that will not be described since those could be spoilers) and are just so much background noise.  Another slightly annoying feature is the one ""normal"" American-looking street in Jericho - clearly a limited set piece since the show was filmed in Romania. This pretty much limited location shots that were supposed to be off-campus.  There were fun call-backs to the original TV show and films, such as the double-snap to gain access to the secret society lair. There was also a quick-and-you'll-miss-it reference to an ""Addams family reunion"". A brief portrait of a relative of Cousin Itt (yes with two t's) was shown, but they somehow also gave him a first name, making Itt his last name. That's incorrect. But other references, such as to Grandma Addams, or even Pubert (from the second film) are not to be found.  There was one fun trivia fact: the coffee shop called the Weathervane, is named after the student newspaper in Westfield (NJ) High School where Charles Addams was the graphic design director of the Weathervane while a student at Westfield HS. As someone who was born in Westfield, the ""shadow"" and legacy of Charles Addams looms large across the town and Westfielders will appreciate the shout-out.  For season 2, it will be hard to undo some of the negatives experienced in season 1. It would be more appropriate to have Wednesday and her friends interacting with more of the ""normies"" outside Jericho. Now that it has been a Netflix hit, maybe there will be a budget to shoot season 2 somewhere in the US instead of Romania.  Overall: 7 out of 10 with room for improvement.",6,neutral,positive
I liked the first season but the second season pacing and story lines are even better. There's new hope.,10,positive,positive
"Peaky Blinders is a gripping crime drama that transports viewers to post-World War I Birmingham, where the Shelby family, led by the charismatic yet troubled Tommy Shelby, builds a ruthless empire. The series is a masterclass in storytelling, blending historical intrigue with personal drama and complex, morally ambiguous characters.  Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding performance as Tommy Shelby, portraying him as both a fierce leader and a haunted soul. His layered performance, along with the strong supporting cast, adds depth to the series, making each character compelling and multi-dimensional. The show's unique style, with modern music juxtaposed against its 1920s setting, creates a distinct and edgy atmosphere, elevating its impact and appeal.  The plot is tightly woven, full of tension, betrayals, and power struggles that keep viewers on edge. With its stunning cinematography, iconic soundtrack, and deep character exploration, Peaky Blinders is a visually and emotionally captivating series that leaves a lasting impression.",9,positive,positive
"Although this show was available to watch, I just did not feel like watching a western that generally dont appeal to me. But I am pleasantly surprised by how wonderfully this has been made. Kudos to Taylor Sheridan whose direction is simply amazing. The whole production is top class and well worth the watch. Top of the line actors make it very interesting, with special mention to Hauser and Reilly, both of whom are exceptional in their acting chops. Costner is good as the head of the Dutton family. Very interesting storyline along with picturesque backdrops. What a wonderful show, indeed and highly, highly recommended!",9,positive,positive
"I can't remember when I first started watching this show, and I can't even tell you what got me to watch it in the first place. Was it the actors and actresses? Was it the era? Was it the story? I don't know, but something peaked my interest. I finally watched the last season probably a year after it came out because after watching the show, I didn't want it to end. This Show is purely magnificent and different. The characters are amazing and disturbing, but memorable. My favorites include Aberama for his calm yet Intimidating demeanor, Alfie for his Humor and intimidating demeanor, and Isaiah for his loyalty thoughtout the show even if he had limited appearances. The story main focus is pretty straightforward, but dives into many different plots. My favorites include season would be season 4 due to the gritty revenge plot. So many great performances from the actors and actresses, and Cillian Murphy is expectedly the coal to this Fire series.",10,positive,positive
"Completely agree with the majority of the reviewers here.. Seasons 1-2 are amazing. But once the book ended, it's just Groundhogs Day of June's misery over and over. It's just enough already.  My biggest issue with the series as a whole as though the concepts are honestly quite far-fetched.. I realize some on here want to think it's not, but it really is. But even if you pretend a completely totalitarian society with only men in charge is feasible, I think it's MORE ridiculous to not even remotely suggest that racism wouldn't go hand-in-hand with the homophobia and hatred of women. I think overall that the writers of this series knew there would be no way they could have a predominately white cast so they ignored the biggest ""horror"" of today's society and made The Handmaid's Tale post-racial. Completely ridiculous and I think as a whole made the entire concept even harder to believe. You mean all of these white Commander wives would have no problem with a handmaid of color!? Come on.",10,positive,positive

"I just finished the last season 2 episode and I'm left speechless and in tears. I bow deeply to Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni because they did what all other directors and producers in the last 38 years couldn't pull off. They finally succeeded in bringing back the real and original Star Wars feeling we've been waiting for since 1982 after Return of the Jedi. I mean, let's be honest, episode 1, 2, 3 and Solo were just awful. Episode 7, 8, 9 were a little bit better. Only Rogue One nearly hit the spot but now with The Mandalorian it was bullseye. I'm just wondering how they're gonna top this with season 3 but I have faith in Jon and Dave.",6,neutral,positive

"This series has to be one of the best in recent times, if not the best. The character development, story, cinematography and plot are all on point. I'm not going over old ground because previous reviews already do it justice, but suffice to say I think it's outstanding. And as for Rip, what a character!",10,positive,positive
"The show is very Entertaining, was well written, has a great pace and the directing was on point (Tim Burton did not disappoint in this). The only critique is on the casting of the rest of the Addams family (and from old fans) - Gomez was a bigger charmer, Morticia had a more notable aura/was controlling of the room and Pugsley had a bigger and naughtier personality - they fall a bit flat (note that they weren't terrible, there was just something missing that they did not bring to the table). That aside, the season was throroughly entertaining and hope this is the beginning of a large and successful franchise reboot.",9,positive,positive
"Disney mucked it all up with their dreadful series of Stars Wars starting with the characters, the storylines and then the political correctness rubbish...then comes along The Mandalorian and all of a sudden it's raised the bar back to a George Lucas feel.  This has been the best thing since they left Jar Jar Binks off the shelf.",10,positive,positive
Henry Cavill and the fight sequences are the main reason to watch this series. Even with those redeeming features I still gave up watching around halfway due to lack of interest. The series wasn't terrible but it lacked coherence and flow.  For context I played and loved the Witcher 3 but prior to that did not have any knowledge of the franchise or stories.  After being disappointed by the TV series I subsequently started reading The Last Wish (many of the episodes in Series 1 are based on this book). The book is far clearer and more enjoyable than the TV series in my opinion.  I found many episodes lacked exposition whereas the book makes clear exactly why things are happening. There are numerous examples and nearly every episode has omitted key information that would have made the story more enjoyable.  Another key difference is in the book Geralt and his sidekick have a far more jovial relationship whereas in the TV series Geralt seems to resent and be strongly annoyed by the presence of his main 'friend'.  This backfired in an episode where his so-called friend gets injured and he goes on a mission to save him. In the book it works but in the TV series you feel that Geralt would be just as likely to leave him .,6,neutral,positive
"I liked the 2nd episode better than the Pilot as it had more intensity in the scenes. The atmosphere and ambient sound was especially good on home theatre systems so I do advise future virwing to use surround sound. I have never played the game and I can quitr easily say that if you inserted this into an episode of The Walking Dead, many viewers would simply see it as a branch of the story-arc.  It has the feel and visuals of high production values. The practical effects and prosthetics complement the story and chill and the pacing is done just right in introducing the threat that is the parasite.  Pedro is slowly becoming my favorite actor as most of his films I have rated at 8. Looking forward to Mandalorian season 3.  I enjoyed it enough to keep pushing into the next episodes. Perhaps my ratings would change.",8,positive,positive
"The Witcher is a series that you'll want to watch. Especially if you're a fan of the book and/or the video game. Henry Cavill is dedicated to the role of Geralt, and he delivers ten-fold in season 1. And finally Season 2 has a release date. From the trailer it will be even better. ????",9,positive,positive
"The first time I watched this, I made it maybe 10 minutes in, turned it off and thought 'Wow, this is awful' since it seemed like such a ridiculous stereotypical show for young teens or something.  I kept reading about it being a great show, and I was confused wondering if other people had actually watched the same thing, so I decided to give it another chance. Turns out if I had just kept watching it gets a lot better.  The opening to the show is painful, the tour Enid provides to Wednesday of the school is atrocious - but I guess that's because she's explaining everything as she sees it. Her personality is some sort of annoying social media addicted teen stereotype. She is supposed to be completely the opposite of Wednesday. This is not the tone of the show, and that character does improve over time.  Unfortunately it was that tour that caused me to turn it off, and I can't help but wonder how many other viewers were lost to it. After that, it's actually good.  I have a lot of minor issues with the show otherwise - Gomez and Morticia seem a bit off to me, but that's because my last exposure to those characters they were played by Raul Julia and Anjelica Houston.  Wednesday's tendency to say edgy things occasionally just come across as a teen trying to sound edgy and I do wish they'd tone that down just a little bit. It usually doesn't add anything. It's one thing when some sort of horrific thing is mentioned and she's like 'sounds great!', it's another when she just blurts out something like 'if you hears screams I'm probably just enjoying myself' before going into a cave.  It probably wouldn't hurt if they leaned into the fact that Wednesday is blatantly neurodivergent and not just weird, which the actress is obviously portraying (and portraying well at that), it's just never mentioned or addressed.  Overall it is good and I've enjoyed it.",9,positive,positive
"The Witcher season 1 was much better than I was expecting. The time jumps can be a little confusing to start, but it's just the beginning of a great story. The actors really nailed their parts. Can't wait for season 2! I really hope they take their time with this one and don't rush it like another fantasy show whose name we won't mention.",7,neutral,positive
"The wonderful dialogues that were contained in the book are simply childish in this series, the creators completely did not use the potential of the psychopathic character of Rience (this character had great potential for the entire third season, it could be presented as well as Ramsay's character in GOT!). Mrs. Lauren completely does not understand either Sapkowski's books or the game from CD PROJECT RED. There are no political games that were thoroughly described in the book that gave the whole story meaning. No sense of map, geography of the world! The producer of the series does not respect the LORE of this book, in fact, she is rewriting it, except that it is so senseless and incomprehensible that it is not surprising that Henry Cavill (a huge fan of books and games) simply resigned from this role. This is simply not watchable.",6,neutral,positive

"Good show like Reacher also has new ways to stay fresh,Although the story of each season is not that strong but still impactful.the acting is constantly good from Alan as Reacher in every episode that makes it much more likeable to his Cool character than the story itself. Only One thing would be shifting to way of how it character works but bringing back Rosoco (the blonde cop) from season 1 will make it better for long lasting story of the show. Negily part (the helper girl) is decent but always fails to deliver perfectly appropriate chemistry between her and Reacher. Hopefully we get more seasons from this show.",10,positive,positive
"A hodge-podge of movie echo's and cliches  I started out watching the first episode of this show with high hopes for a solid new and innovating Sci-Fi adventure in comparison to the classic Star Wars. Boy, was I disappointed! Even to a point that I wanted to hit the stop button already after 10 minutes in the first episode.  All the cliches of American movie making seemed to be put in this show. An overly done western B movie using cliches that have been used a trillion times, only this time not with cowboys, Mexicans using Gatling guns and horses, but with people in Halloween costumes and make-up and not horses but .... Eh, well I don't even care how this super wild thing was called the main character could tame with the cliché words ""easy boy"" etc.  I forced myself to watch this first episode till the end, but if this is what American film making nowadays has come to, using the faint echoes of outstanding movies with actors like Clint Eastwood and milking out the only part of history America seems to be proud of, namely the Wild West era, then let's turn our heads to Asia where new ideas and innovating movie making is still possible.  I really don't understand and I definitely don't believe that America also is not packed with innovating (young) film makers, but what hits the big screens is movies on a children's level, using themes that have been used way, way, way too much and numb the audience with endless repetition of movie cliches. Totally nothing refreshing but spreading a fog of boredom that numbs you.  I didn't bother to start the second episode and started to watch a Korean mini series called The Witch's Diner, which in its simple lightness, has way more value and knows how to get real acting and messages across better than these hundreds of millions costing carnivalesque dressed up hodge-podge of movie echo's and cliches. America what happened to your innovating role in the movie world?",7,neutral,positive
"Seems so long that I've been waiting for a 8.9 plus IMDb series to come on, the likes of breaking bad, the sopranos etc then this morning I see this with like a 9.7 with over 2k ratings, so had to check it out and boy Im glad I did.. I didn't even know this had been made till this morning either.. Haven't played the game so can't base it off that, can only base this off the first episode, seems like a real good plot good length for a season opener at nearly an hour and a half which I liked. Great acting can't wait for the 2nd episode. Would definitely recommend.if I had a playstation I would love to go and see the similarities everyone is talking of.",2,negative,positive
"This series is so horrific you want to look away, but can't. I watched an episode, and had to stop, think about the dark path it leads the viewer on, and decide if I really wanted to go that dark. I did. It's a very painful watch, some episodes leave you curled up in a fetal position. As intended!  Every single cast member is perfect in their roles, believable and Honestly I don't know how they do something this difficult, over and over.  This show grabs you angers you, shocks you, but you always end the episodes wanting the next one right away.",7,neutral,positive

This is one of my favorite shows on television. I've been a huge fan since the beginning. The characters had a lot of depth and personality. This played well adding the two prequel shows as well. It went downhill the last season with the hiatus. The ending gave me huge Game of Thrones disappointment flashbacks. The last episode just seemed like a mad rush to wrap everything up. So sad to see such a great show go this route! I wish the creator had put as much effort into maintaining the entire story line as he does making new shows. Maybe Taylor Sheridan needs to finish one project before beginning the next.,10,positive,positive

"Not only is the first season a fresh, brilliant comedy, but it gives us a peek at what it's like to be in the service industry. We get to see what a pain it is to serve clients at a resort.  The writing is witty, clever, shocking at times and screamingly funny. The writer really understands human nature, including teens. The acting is outstanding with fantastic casting choices.  This is an example of what can be achieved in a TV series when excellent writing, directing and acting come together.  White Lotus would make my top list of the all time best series. Very rarely is a TV show this good.",6,neutral,positive

"Some of the most interesting things happen when escapees talk and try and organize in Canada. More secret notes/missions back and forth. This whole side of the story is pretty quiet.  I'm editing this because I've gone back and rewatched a bunch of episodes... Also, I read this book in highschool in 1988. It's very interesting how the first season covered the book so quickly and it's great that the writers have been able to continue to make the story compelling, but again, I want to see more... There's a whole community of escapees from Gilead in Canada... it'd be great to see some of them organize to re-infiltrate back.. a mission... push the US rep in Canada to do something.. even convert that person to then lead it.  It's a dystopian tale, but it doesn't mean there can't be a heightening of resistance to the point of action... then decide where the story goes.",8,positive,positive
"This series is an absolute must watch. It hooked me in after the first episode! I had no idea how they were going to pull off another series seeing as the first one ended where the book ends. Think they have done a fab job with keeping the story intriguing, interesting and still has its surprises. The one and only negative thing is that there are way too many lingering shots on Elisabeth Moss. I get that they're trying to keep the tension and give us a sense of her emotions but it's just too obvious and much sometimes. Seriously good other than that, in my top 10 tv series ever.",9,positive,positive
"I grew up in Hawaii starting back in 1965 at the age of ten then moved to the mainland in 1982. I go back home each year to see my family and friends and to reconnect with the land and culture I hold close to my heart.  This said, I am impressed by the authentic references about Hawaii. Some are obvious while others are subtle but noticed.  Love the song selections from 70s/80s contemporary Hawaiian musicians. Quinn on the beach tripping on whales breaching and observing the outrigger team ritual/camaraderie upon landing, very accurate. Kai's speech about the family land - their aina - was nicely done.  Kudos to the creators for doing this.",9,positive,positive

"This show continues to blow me away. It plunges the depths of what it really takes to build a rebellion. It asks how its's done, what's the real cost, and why there even needs to be one. It actually shows us the inner workings of the empire and why we should despise them. It's beautifully written, directed, acted, and shot. Each episode gets better and better(you have no idea). The speeches given in E10 are god level. This is better than any other star was property, including the OG films. Cant believe I'm saying this, but a star wars show might be the best prestige tv show of the year.  ""I burn my life to make a sunrise that I know I'll never see.""

"I remember watching and appreciating The Adams Family with Christina Ricci as a kid. No, I haven't seen the original and don't care about the comparisons. Anyway, I went into this one with no expectations and was not disappointed. There were good references, but the writer, director, and cast made this their own story and did a phenomenal job. It sucked me right in with the incredible cast and characters along with the murder mystery. Definitely some twists and turns to keep you on your toes. Plenty of dark humor, and great dialogue. I really enjoyed seeing the growth in some of the characters as well. I flew through the season faster than expected. Suffice it to say Wednesday kept my attention. Can't wait for more seasons!",5,neutral,positive

"The acting and storyline through the initial episodes was compelling, though somewhat borderline compared with the first season. The ending was such a letdown because it was so cliche and predictable. I expected a death -- as one possibility I even expected the death that occurred -- but the way that it happened was just too easy, too convenient. The resolution of the the character conflicts was too outside of reality to maintain credulity. The outsized jealousy issues by one character stretched the imagination, and the final scene of lovemaking with his wife did little to tell that those issues were at an end. The most believable character was Portia, who at the end still tried to do what she set out to do, live her own life while serving her boss, even though she didn't realize her own life was likely at risk.",1,negative,positive

I've read people find it confusing and with the same plot over and over but I'm not sure they're really get the story line. The series does flip through episodes with remembrance sequences to show you how it came to be leaning up to the first few episodes. So you may have to rewatch if you haven't watched in a while to remember where you are in the time line of events and recaps.  With Henry Cavil as the main character, this series was obviously going to be good.",10,positive,positive
"Show wasn't bad. Just wasn't amazing. Zeta Jones had the right look, but didn't have the right mannerisms or attitude. Gomez was probly the best surprise in the Addams family. Wednesday could have been better, pugsly was weak. And of course netflix had to add wokeness into it on more than one occasion. All in all it was a decent watch. But I won't watch it more than once. Definitely not my favorite, and definitely not on par with the 90's version.  Really had higher hopes for this show. And really had high hopes Netflix would do it justice to the original. But it fell flat to the movies. If you just take it for what it is, it won't be a disappointment. If you compare it to the movies, it's a complete let down.",1,negative,positive
"I'll start off positive, the main character's actor, Jenna Ortega, did a phenomenal job, I absolutely loved her style and attitude and everything, she was great and I will watch season two almost solely because of her portrayal of Wednesday. The roommate grew on me overtime, but she definitely had the Disney vibe that some of the show had, which I really dislike, the dumbing down of a lot of the lines which forced this show to seem childish. I was really hoping for a dark/weird/gross/creepy vibe to the show but I feel that there was almost none of that, it was surprisingly bright/colourful/vibrant which I think it also gave me Disney vibes. And lastly the writing at times was great, but then many other times was cringey as hell, like it seemed as if once they wrote the dialog, they then passed it on to children to force in new slang or something, I don't know what they did but it felt off at times.  Now all that said I'm definitely keen for season two, and will probably enjoy a re-watch of season one before I start season 2.",7,neutral,positive

"Wednesday series dives into the world of Wednesday Addams, that dark and funny character from the Addams Family. Tim Burton made this show, and it follows Wednesday as a teenager. She's at a strange school called Nevermore Academy,and she's trying to figure things out like any teen.  The actress Jenna Ortega is perfect as Wednesday. She's innocent, funny, and a little creepy, just like the character should be. She makes you feel for Wednesday and laugh at her jokes too. If you notice Jenna Ortega she never blinked her eyes in the seens. The other actors are great as well, especially the ones who play Wednesday's parents, Morticia and Gomez. They all work well together and make the family feel real.  This show is funny, dark, and mysterious, just like the original Addams Family. It will keep you guessing as Wednesday tries to solve secrets at Nevermore.  If you liked the previous Addams Family shows, then you'll love this new show! Even if you haven't seen them before, this spooky and surprising series is sure to bewitch you.",8,positive,positive

"The season started strong but as it continued the writing got lazy. I'm ok with implausible/suspend disbelief for the sake of a plot or situation, But the last few episodes of S3 constantly demanded this from viewers. It's the simple things like people making it from one location to another in unreasonable amounts of time or using a simple explanation to resolving a seemingly complicated missing girl mystery. The final straw was the implausible last couple of ""action"" scenes in the finale.  The first 2 seasons were top notch and I highly recommend them. Only watch S3 if you don't want to think about it with more than 5% of your brain .",10,positive,positive
"Rewatching season one of The Last of Us before the premiere of season two isn't just about brushing up on the story-it's about feeling the emotional weight settle differently the second time around. The show doesn't rely on shock or cheap suspense. It runs on grief, adaptation, and the slow, brutal evolution of what people become when the world doesn't give them time to heal. And this time through, the things that mattered hit harder because you know what's coming. You know what gets lost.  Pedro Pascal's Joel isn't a stoic badass-he's broken, angry, shut down, and only barely functional. And it's that fracture that makes him watchable. He doesn't try to be likable. He just is what trauma made him. Bella Ramsey's Ellie, on the other hand, is pure instinct-fierce, emotionally blunt, and too young to carry what she ends up holding. But she does anyway. And that's where the show thrives-not in its spectacle, but in what it doesn't flinch away from.  One of the best parts of the rewatch is how the show treats its quieter moments. For example, the episode with Sam and Henry doesn't try to hammer in some ""message"" about disability-it just lets it be part of the world. Sam being deaf isn't treated like a ""very special episode"" moment; it's handled naturally, with his brother signing to him the way any sibling would in that situation. What stood out more this time was how Ellie adapts. When she realizes he uses a magnetic writing pad to communicate, she just rolls with it. No hesitation, no awkwardness, no big production. Just kids, trying to connect. And that's exactly what kids would do. In a world that's already falling apart, they don't care about age gaps or ""differences."" They care about being understood. And the show gets that right.  Ellie's attempt to save him with her blood? That's not about medical logic-it's about hope weaponized by desperation. It's what a child thinks heroism looks like. And when it fails, you feel it not just as a tragic beat, but as a shattering-a moment where her belief in ""maybe"" starts to die. And the show just lets her bleed anyway.  Episode three still feels like lightning in a bottle. Frank and Bill's relationship is portrayed with rare honesty-not performative, not sanitized, just complicated and true. Love in the apocalypse doesn't need grandeur-it needs someone to grow strawberries with. That episode still might be one of the most beautifully written pieces of television in the last decade.  By the time you get to David-the cult leader, cannibal, predator wrapped in faux-spiritual survivalism-Ellie's rage becomes something ancient. When she takes him out with that knife, it's not just about him. It's everything. Every person she's lost. Every time she's had to save herself. That moment should be overkill. But instead it's earned.  And yeah, Joel lies to her. And yeah, she knows.  But she lets him lie. Because at that point, he's all she has left-and maybe she's all he has too.  That isn't weakness. That's human math. A twisted kind of love wrapped in survival logic.  And it lands.  Rewatching The Last of Us reminded me why this show matters.  Not because it's another prestige apocalypse drama, or because it's an adaptation done right-  but because it's willing to sit in the silence and let real people fall apart.  No saving grace.  No reset button.  Just the cost of love and the damage it leaves behind.  Season two has big shoes to fill.  But if it even half-remembers the heart behind all this pain,  I'm in.",8,positive,positive
"So one evening, Gogglebox was on TV in the background. They played a clip of The Handmaid's Tale and I'll be honest... I was gripped! It was only 3 minutes or so however, it was enough to make me want to watch it. When I started watching it, I was so pleased I did. This is a great TV show, great cast, fascinating story line.  I've read a couple of reviews on here which don't seem to have the same reaction as me... one sad person even labelled it ""torture porn"" - I can honestly say this person was talking out of their... well... anyway, it's really good, very interesting, thought provoking and definitely something I'm going to continue watching.  I'd recommend this series to anyone and so far, everyone I have recommended it to have really enjoyed it.

"In each episode at least 10 minutes distributed to scenes in the episode have no effect on the development of events and it is possible to delete them easily, and also from some of these scenes scenes between John and herself some of them really show what the character believes and some of them do not help. The coloring is one of the distinct and distinctive signs in this series. There are two colors in the series, one in Gilead, which is coloring in dark yellow or dark blue, which gave a feeling of discomfort, and on the contrary in Canada the coloring was saturated with colors and comfortable for the eye more, and here lies the genius and It is to show the areas where they are resting and the areas that have discomfort and fatigue to the nerves by coloring. Acting in the series is a question mark for me, for example, the character of Elizabeth Moss was sometimes excellent and some of them are exaggerated acting accompanied by some of the exaggerations , and the performance of the actress who performed the role of Serena was above the excellent and is better away completely from weakness or vulgarity, As for Farid's performance, he was weak at times, especially in the third season. The other seasons were impressive. Flashback scenes abounded in the series, and they were without any benefit the events that affected the building of the characters, and the series failed to present it or its importance, and I felt that it was just a waste of time. There are many loopholes at the level of dramatic construction, so I could not interact or be affected by any of the characters (I will explain in the next point) and from the loopholes of the dramatic construction are the reasons for this brutal world in a moment and the characters turned so quickly to all these evils, and also there are problems On the level building science fiction and it is also linked to the children of the dramatic and the dimensions of this world and that brutality that exists among people. One of the solutions that I would have put forward is, for example, that these people are drugged and are being manipulated and the series was able to present that, due to the nature of its classification and It is science fiction. Building the characters themselves and their absolute evil and not explaining how they were transformed into all these evils. Montage clips have no relation to events, and they do not even help in the development of characters or their expression, such as repetition of the sense of suffering from people to the point of vulgarity. At the end of the following season, I began to be affected more by the characters due to the development of events. series.  The series quotes some Harriet ideas, which are smuggling some persecuted people from their place to better places for them.  The series was clever in dropping some symbols on the Isl**amic world and the Ar**ab world, and I noticed that from the veiling of women aunts and the use of mothers and slaves and marriage for reli**gious reasons, and also when searching for the word Gilad I found that it is a region in the Ar**ab countries in the past during the era of the Isl**amic state and Show the persecution of women in those countries.",4,negative,positive
S 3 episode 6 is nail in this seasons coffin. Bad acting and weak story lines mixed with cheap filmography. Lizzo can't carry a line. Jack Black lacked his usual magic. Now adding Mandolorian to the other failed Disney Star Wars spin-offs like Boba Fett amd Andor all suffer bad acting boring story lines and cheap filmography. Need to cancel my subscription.  Disney doesn't seem to be able to develop new content and may be a reason they keep redoing old movies that were amazing and now they feel they need to redo. We need Disney to get back to being a creative powerhouse. Only the parks have magic left.,9,positive,positive
"There is little I can say that hasn't been said before by more articulate viewers-the fact that every episode left me full of dread and rage sums up how brilliant this adaptation is. Fabulously acted, horrifyingly real and reflecting some real world issues in a way that didn't feel spoon fed or condescending. I probably won't watch again, but only because it's just too close too home.",10,positive,positive
"The show is pretty good. My kids liked it but they do drop a few GD's which is unnecessary. Also whoever was in charge of casting Gomez Addams sucks. He is supposed to be a suave character not a short, fat guy always groveling to Morticia all the time. Raul Julia was the best Gomez Addams hands down. He was suave and treated Morticia with respect and you could just tell he loved her more than anything. The new guy, Luis Guzman is a good actor but not for this role. Recast Gomez!! Catherine Zeta Jones did a good job and the casting for Wednesday was spot on. The show was well done and my kids are looking forward to the second season.",8,positive,positive

"First of all I'd like to say that if you haven't played the game before and have the ability to do so, I'd strongly recommend you to experience this story that way first. It's truly one of the greatest games of all time in my opinion and this adaptation does not capture it's magic.  First of all, let's talk about the acting: Pedro Pascal is solid as Joel. He looks the part and embodies the character pretty well but still come off as a bit stiff in comparison to Troy Bakers masterful portrayal.  Bella Ramsay on the other hand is completely miscast as Ellie. She neither looks nor plays the part. While she can't be faulted for the former, I don't think she has the acting range necessary to inhabit the character. Sure, I don't know what directions they gave her on set, but she seems to only possess a handful of facial expressions in total. Where Ellie in the game could come off as nervous, excited and childish, she mostly comes off as bored here. Bella simply fails to instill the character with the sense of life that she has in the game, which is ironic for a live action portrayal.  As for the other actors, they mostly do a good job. There are no standout performances but no really bad ones either, with the exception of Melanie Lynskey (but more on her later).  The major problems of this adaptation however are the pacing and deviations from the source material. All in all, we get a 9 hour long season to cover the event of the first game, which is already pretty tight. The matter isn't helped by dedicating an hour to Bill's gay romance story, which contributes nothing to the overall narrative while deviating completely from the game. The runtime is stretched thinner by adding additional side-characters that at best does little for the story. The worst offender in this category is Kathleen, awfully played by Lynskey in one of the most unconvincing roles I've witnessed. Not in a hundred years could I see her being a leader of a crew like that. I won't go through every little change but the end result is that the story feels very rushed. This, in turn, leads to the underdevelopment of the relationship between Joel and Ellie; the pillar of the story.  Another annoyance I had was the lack of brutality in the show. The violence in the game helped make the world feel bleak and gritty. Here, on the other hand, we get plenty of off-screen deaths and hardly any blood and gore, making the world feel way to sanitized.  Reading through my review, I realize my score may come off as rather generous. But I do think that it's still worth a watch, even if it fails to live up to it's excellent source material.",10,positive,positive
"Just like the title say, it's been a surprisingly fun show. I mean I knew it's going to be cheesy action series so I treated it as such and had fun. Last episode was painfully cheap though, I couldn't sit through it. I would have given it a higher rating otherwise.",9,positive,positive

"I think the whole premise of this project was interesting from the start. A modernized and focused spin-off of a decades-old gothic sitcom? Sure, let's give it a try.  Without any real spoilers, the premise of the show is Wednesday Adams being forced to sign up for a boarding school for monsters. The plot is essentially a watered down monster harem anime meets Scooby Doo. A mystery is set up and it's explored with some average quality writing.  There are a handful of spot on gags that genuinely made me smile, they are the exception rather than the norm, but they were still good enough to be memorable. Detracting from the well done jokes are a few pretty annoying identity politics references that are out of place enough to stick out oddly. Keep politics out of entertainment please.  So far, I would have probably given the show a mediocre 4 stars due to very uneven writing. However, Jenna Ortega absolutely, positively, amazingly grabs the screen. She portrays her character excellently, delivers the humor, and happens to be a very beautiful person. She is everything good about this show and grabs the screen so well that she makes an otherwise mediocre Netflix show worth watching.  Writing, plot, pacing: 4/10 Jenna Ortega 10/10 Overall score: 6/10.",7,neutral,positive
"Whoever wrote season 3 has no idea of their audience. This was written for children in high school who need hints for their tests where they must pick the best choice out of multiple choices; A. B. or C... and E. Where the answer is "" All the above"". There is Zero nuance and a pathetic rush to cram everything into a 4 part scenario. Seriously lightweight writing compared to season 1 and 2 . Reachers character is more worried about being pumped before the shoot than actual good acting. But hey, Noone said he was an A lister to begin with. Season 3 is a letdown. The chick w the Boston accent is weak as well. Who would've thunk?",10,positive,positive

"Andor was every bit as good as I was hoping for. It might be the best Star Wars series to date, I used to think it was The Mandalorian but these two seasons of Andor have been flawless. Of all the Star Wars series so far this one is probably the least known character but that doesn't mean it's any less interesting. Andor is a character from one of the best Star Wars movies, Rogue One. All the reviews have been great for Andor so that got my expectations even higher and so far they've all been met. It has a real gritty feel to it compared to the other Star Wars series and the visuals are great. It's also more adult oriented compared to the other shows so far. But the cast, led by Diego Luna, is the best thing about this show. Well that and the writing. These two seasons of Andor have been nothing short of incredible and easily the best thing Star Wars has done since the original trilogy.",9,positive,positive
Thank You Amazon for releasing all episodes at once. Hopefully this is the new normal and an end to weekly releases. I'll wait until every episode is released just so I can binge watch.

"This series has it all... comedy, drama, romance, mystery and action all wrapped in a delightfully quirky package. It's rare that I binge watch anything but I was riveted by this show. It's clever. The writing is smart, the costumes and scenics are dazzling and the cinematography took great advantage of the location work in Romania. This level of acting, production design and visual effects are rare in a television series and more what one expects on the big screen. I would've liked a slightly longer season than 8 episodes, I feel 10 would have been better. Still, this show is a winner. Watch it.",9,positive,positive
"The series is really amazing. It reminds me Harry potter. A school with werewolves, weirdos and people with special powers and full of secrets .  It is somehow a mystery about a monster who kill people .  The leading character is a teenage girl , named Wednesday . She is a cold girl that doesn't like to show her feeling but finding some friends who help her in her adventure change her and help her to be more sociable.  The strange thing that happened In the 3rd or 4th episode was that she unbelievably go to a party with a boy she had met in a cafe. Which seamed weird because they had just met and the change shouldn't be happen that soon.  It was an interesting . I wished i could see the second season.",10,positive,positive

I have a new found respect and admiration for Cillian Murphy who leads the show as Thomas Shelby, the success driven gangster leader of the Peaky Blinders gang. I binge watched this show and am so happy I did! Do yourself a favor and take the time to watch this show! You will not regret doing so. Peaky Blinders keeps me on my toes. I never know what the Shelby family are prepping to do next! This show is an absolute home run!",9,positive,positive
"Yellowstone is an incredible journey, like those you don't see anymore. This show that started out in 2018, is still one of the best if not the best TV series even as 2022 is coming to an end.  But the heart and soul of this show are its characters, that feel as real as it can get. They make mistakes, they have their priorities, they teach us things good and bad, but above all it's the interaction between those characters and the lessons they learn and give to one another, that really defeat anything else currently on TV.  John Dutton, a man that only wishes to live his final days doing what he does best, has to be the main force stopping corporate or just vengeful interests from destroying his family and legacy. Kevin Costner shows why he's one of the best actors of his and even the current generation.  Beth Dutton is an amazing character. She's the true example of what a strong female character looks like. She's both the Sigourney Weaver and the Sarah Connor of Yellowstone. She's strong but vulnerable, she's smart but makes several mistakes in her personal life, she can take on anyone but she needs those she loves.  Rip Wheeler is in some ways the son John Dutton wanted, but no less loyal and caring than a real son. He'll do what it takes to defend what is his world, and those he loves. He'll not only fight fire with fire, but he'll bring napalm just to make sure once the enemies are down they don't get back up. He's not heartless, far from it. In many ways he's the wisest, seeing what others cannot see or refuse to see.  Kayce is perhaps the weakest link. From beginning until now he has still not figured out who he is, and where he stands. He's a good man in a world becoming darker and crueler. His intentions are always the best but he keeps getting pushed into situations that should've already eliminated all his doubts. And together in a similar line is Monica Dutton, Kayce wife. She at least has learned from her lessons, and set aside her doubts. She's the rock that keeps Kayce from falling apart. And where Beth is fire Monica is water.  Jamie at this point shouldn't be part of the show at all. If not for what he has done, at least because he knows nothing of loyalty or family. And he's always being used even by those he thinks he's using.  Join to memorable characters amazing filming, utilizing to their max the landscapes of Montana, and there's almost nothing in this show that fails in terms of quality.  Yellowstone is one of those shows that will be remembered for generations to come.",7,neutral,positive

"As a fan of Lee Child's literary saga, I woke up when the first film starring Tom Cruise, based on the book ""A Shot,"" was released. Although he wasn't the actor one would imagine from the literary descriptions, he did have the charisma and presence (despite his height).  The second film was a flop and a disappointment, so I thought the franchise wouldn't get any more adaptations.  When Amazon greenlit the series project, with Alan Ritchson as Reacher, it was a wonderful feeling.  These two seasons have adapted two very good books, and since the franchise is run more or less like an anthology, the commission will never matter.  Ritchson has the presence, charisma, and physique needed; we don't need to be a good actor or for the series to have elaborate plot twists; he gets straight to the point, and that's greatly appreciated. It's like going back to the action series and movies of the 80s and 90s without fear or shame.  Make no mistake, it's a very good series, very well written, and the characters are charismatic, which is appreciated.  Among so many products characterized by a stated agenda, having one that, simply and sincerely, with all that entails, is a success, and this is demonstrated by the metrics that make it one of the best on the platform.  I hope for a third season soon and see how well it adapts.  Updated March 27, 2025 The third season has just ended, and ""Reacher"" truly continues on the same path.  It's a series that works very well because the material it adapts is excellent.  The book for this season is ""Persuader,"" which I read a few months ago.  While there are quite a few liberties regarding the characters and the story, it maintains the spirit of what we see there quite well.  Plots and some characters have been removed in favor of a more dynamic narrative, making Nealey a fundamental part of the story and for Reacher.  I truly believe this series easily lasts 10 seasons and will never get boring, so Prime Video truly has another product that works ""on its own."" There's no need to add much more than what's already written, and that's a good thing.  I'll eagerly await season 4.",10,positive,positive
"The bare basics of this show is watching men sit, drink or have sex. There's no back bone and can drag a fair bit. I got all the way to season 3 before deciding enough was enough. No where near enough action and violence compared to sex scenes, nudity and alcoholism. It's a sufficiently more boring and stripped back version of game of thrones in my opinion. Saying that it's great if you're trying to eat dinner with background noise.",7,neutral,positive
"I like the dark humour of the family Addams, how it is almost creepy. This series was disappointing in the sense of it was way too kids friendly. I mean it tried being dark/creepy and had some great jokes and characters. Tim Burton did a great job, but his style did not show through in every aspect where it was very much needed. Like the storyline. But if I feel comfortable letting a ten-year-old watch this, then it isn't really the level of creepy/dark I expected when watching as an adult. I wished we saw some more of Wednesday in an ordinary school. After watching the trailer, that dynamic was really interesting and outside that trailer segment, there was nothing more basically. The plot here was nothing special honestly, a storyline we seen way too many times before, and it fell flat. I found this mediocre. Where the good pointers were mellowed down with bad ones. Did not regret watching it, but definitely not a favourite.",5,neutral,positive

There's character development for sure But the plot falls flat. The denouement (if I can call it that!) is not satisfying and does not make sense. If anything it doesn't achieve anything. Overall, take away the decor/location and the designer clothes and the stunning views of Sicily and you're left with nothing. I actually think the creators do Not know how to do satire.

"This is what Tim Burton takes on Hogwarts and Harry Potter. Our protagonist, Wednesday Addams, got into trouble (as always) and was sent to Nevermore Academy, a school for the outcasts. So begin Wednesday's journey into monster, visions and of course schoolmates rivalry.  And what a school without tournament. Right?! In Nevermore they have Edgar Allan Poe Cup or Poe Cup in short. Four houses compete to be best, at all cost and tricks. And oh yeah, it went more like Ben Hur's chariot race rather than Quidditch game.  Wednesday has a nemesis too, And his name was (yes, you can say his name) Joseph Crackstone. There is also a (not so) secret society called Nightshade, principal in the form of Brienne of Tarth and chamber of secrets (pun intended)  Wednesday's first season feels refreshing and exciting. I can't wait for second season. Hopefully, there would be a Teacher Againts The Dark Arts, with a deep and intimidating voice: ""Wednesday Addams. You are neither special nor important, and no, the fate of Nevermore Academy never depends on you""  Refreshing 9/10.",10,positive,positive
"Lately, I have been watching a lot of series and movies and they always struck me as dull and too obvious. However this one had me really fixed in my chair. Beautiful cinematography, wonderful storytelling and brilliant acting. I cannot say much about the story since I do not know anything except for the pilot I have watched. It seems to be a story with a lot of other levels that will open up and intervene in the coming episodes. It might struck one as any other post doomsday scenario though. Somehow it also reminded me of Stranger Things in that it started in 1968 and ended with a beautiful Depeche Mode song. It also reminded me of Hot Skull. Still, it would be too soon to doom it like that. I believe this story has a great potential. I hate starting a series that is airing weekly because waiting is just a real pain. So let the watch for the next episode start.",10,positive,positive
"Peaky Blinders Seasons 1-4  I have watched the lot and it is all very entertaining indeed, it really is no more than a stylish soap with caricatures and stereotypes throughout.  It is highly derivative, from Ripper Street or other such dramas and is just about gangsters and there molls.  Having watching Cillian Murphy alongside Tom Hardy I really fail to see what the fuss is about. Mr Murphy does little or nothing and comes from the minimalist school of acting, whilst he is committed to the role he just has the look of a gypsy from the bogs.  I think this series is popular because it represents the absolute opposite of our modern world full of political correctness and liberal authoritarianism.  Some elements are however totally unacceptable even in a work of fiction;  1, violence is not only glorified but normalised and seen as a perfectly acceptable outcome to nearly every situation.  2, all police are either corrupted or corruptible and that reaches from the bobby on the beat to very corridors of power.  3, sex is demonstrated as either an act of violence or existing purely for the gratification of men.  4, nearly every episodes shouts loudly that crime pays and organised crime leads to the possession of houses, cars, furs and every other form of material wealth.  5, alcohol, cigarettes and cocaine feature relentlessly in most episodes and portrayed as great fun without consequences.",10,positive,positive

I've heard all the rumors and rhetoric about Henry Cavill leaving because of the storyline not being true to originals and although I haven't read the original material, it's obvious something is amiss.

"Seasons one and two were excellent seasons. Two of the most compelling seasons ever for a television series.  Season three started to get ridiculous and I couldn't fathom how June didn't get put on the wall and started actively hoping it would happen to bring some credibility back to the show.  I rolled my eyes all through season four and now I'm basically hate-watching season five as the show has devolved into a ridiculous Wile E. Coyote vs the Road Runner episode. Such is the state of June and Serena's rivalry.  Add to the fact that people involved in this show seem to think that close ups of June seething are akin to character development and you've got one of the biggest drop offs in quality I've ever seen in a series.  Plus, every single character seems intent on taking the dumbest decisions possible so I have to wonder if the writers of this show are laughing at the audience.

"Strong is the word for this series, and little, weak people detest strong so be prepared for the fake reviews and thumbs down across the actual reviews for it. Fear is a powerful thing.  The Handmaid's Tale is perhaps one of the the best Television accomplishments of not only the year (hands down), but of the decade. It is a profound glimpse into a future that could very well happen were it not for people like most of you and me.  In three unforgettable episodes, so far, women such as Offred (""Of FRED"", since she belongs to Fred), played by the inimitable Elisabeth Moss, are coerced through bodily harm to be both concubine and scape/punching goat for well to do families. These women are subjected to physical, emotional and mental abuse in the name of God, or if not so much in the name of God, under the twisted word of god, by man. This is not to say that it is a Christian-bashing show, but it depicts what could happen under a theocratic society.  What is most outstanding is that the acting is so amazing, that its quietest moments may be its most powerful. In fact, at times, the series can be emotionally overwhelming and draining — but isn't that a characteristic of a superb and masterful viewing experience?

I might be biased because I came into this with high expectations. It's a good show, but I feel it could have been more.  A major appeal for people were the steamy scenes, which I'll admit were pretty hot. There is a lot of nudity, mostly in the second season.

The end of season 4 was just not believeble and therefore the work that was done to build up June's charachter just lost the edge for me unfortunately. Great idea and start to the show though!

"Given the poor dialogues and forced private jokes that abound, it would be difficult for the actors to do a better job on the one sided characters their are given.  How the villains are incompetent fighters make the heroes look strong is something that becomes quite annoying, as it happens in every single fight or interrogation scene. The same goes for the villains decision making, which is, you guessed, always so obviously flawed that you just have to keep rolling your eyes.  As in the first season, Reacher's clever deductions and conclusions sound so memorized it's laughable.. But while the first season did a good job for mindless entertaining, the second one definitely came out as more forced, obvious and often times just plain boring.",9,positive,positive
Really feels like they did such a great job on the first two season and then just gave up on season three. Not sure why they have to make it so drawn out and boring. Only one episode left for season three and I just don't think that they have what it takes to pull off a winner this time around. Just really lacks everything the first two seasons had. Really just seems like they wanted to make it so good and you keep getting your hopes up but then you're let down after every episode. Just don't understand why it took 7'months to film this season and you're still left with a mediocre season and still don't have a good storyline.,10,positive,positive
"I can't understand why Lauren Shchmidt Hissrich dreams up new plot. I will understand if she add new threads like in games about the witcher from CD project red, but why she changed almost the entire plot. If she changed the plot for better there would be no problem but is much worse than books. Objectively the plot makes no sense, the interaction between characters are very poor and dialogueas are flat. Only Henry Cavli saves this show.",10,positive,positive
"I have read all the Reacher books and learned that Jack uses his physical and mental skills to handle his adversaries...season one did a fine job showing these skills but season 2 has him using guns all the time and getting his ass kicked in many of the fight scenes. Reacher's ability to subdue a foe with one kick,forearm,or hammering punch and informing the viewer how it will be done has been totally ignored. The stories have been fine and the new cast around him very good but Reacher's combat skills have been reduced to an almost laughable degree. Reacher's command of every fight has been reduced to using a gun to win .I hope that season 3 will restore the Reacher that everyone loves.",8,positive,neutral
One of the best criminal/mafia series that I have ever seen. Hope it will never end.,10,positive,positive
"I was utterly enraptured by the first series - because it so encapsulated what a holiday is - wildly anxious and full of doubt and tension. A brilliantly rich character piece, fantastically woven with stunning performances all round - but Coolidge's troubled McQuoid and Daddario's conflicted journalist stood out for me particularly. There's buckets of layered commentary on contemporary culture, wealth and privilege - although not every part felt vital, and a few decisions, (however well intentioned) made the production itself sometimes trip into the culture in which it is satirising. However when White Lotus hits its stride the tension is unbearable - counterpointed with beautiful music and cinematography. At the core of it though - are the brilliantly observed characters - who all went to make it one summer holiday I'll never forget.  ((In fact, we're none of us allowed to forget it as it got a second series, sharper, tighter and even more tense. The series is getting rightfully lavished with praise from all sides now which is very gratifying))",8,positive,positive
10/10 in every way. Writing. Directing. Acting. Cinematography and editing. Emotional. Gripping. Heartbreaking yet Heartwarming. This is Tv at its best. HBO has the magic sauce for Sunday night television. Perfectly cast. Mazin and Druckman seem to know exactly how to tell this story while staying true to the game and giving us show inventions as well. Mark Mylod has lent his particular expertise bringing extraordinary directing to season 2 episode 2. You cannot argue with credits like game of thrones and succession. This is elite tier stuff not to be missed and definitely not just a zombie show.,9,positive,positive
"Weak series. That's even saying a lot. The only thing that stands out is the acting of the four main characters. The possibilities offered by the story written by Sapkowski and what the screenwriters did... cries out for revenge. I do not recommend, it is better to buy books, audiobooks or the game.  Changing the whole story, introducing a completely different course of events, trivializing the characters. It makes it so weak, shallow and meaningless. Are all new productions supposed to be for people with the problem of thinking, associating facts and lack of reflection?  Netflix you are weak. Start hiring people who have something in their mind apart from pointless showing ass on your series, it doesn't add anything.",10,positive,positive

The story Is awful and lacks development and logic, the characters are simple and predictable.  I can't believe that It is a Tim Burton film.  It Is the typical Netflix film/series with cliches, violence and special effects...they used all the series budget on special effects and famous actors/directors and when they got to writing the story they Just threw random things trying to give the series a story.  The violence Is very severe for a series that has a pegi of 12, i would give It a zero if i could...",10,positive,positive

"Seen the first two Episodes and everything I see feels like they nailed it: This is Star Wars (at least to me). But what constantly irritates me is the music. Sorry, I seem to be so much used to the John Williams Sound that the score often feels like a mismatch to me :/",9,positive,positive
"Overall, I felt that it was good and I felt entertained by the end of the series, BUT, it felt....done before, specifically by The Dark Adventures of Sabrina. Same teenage angst, problems with the popular kids, secret societies...it's Wednesday Friggin Addams, I expected something different from the rest, much like Wednesday herself.  On a side note Catherine Zeta Jones, while picturesque and visually appealing has ZERO screen chemistry with Guzman. Luis Guzman as Gomez was phenomenal, while he didn't look like the Gomez that I grew up with (the movie franchise), I totally bought him in the role. Jones, however, acted as if she were on Fear Factor and being covered in snakes while lying in a tank every time he touched her or tried to interact romantically with her. I honestly don't remember her being that poor of an actress, perhaps she is scarred from being groped by men she views as repulsive?",6,neutral,positive
"I didn't really get into it until around Season 3, that was when I finally started connecting to the characters. Acting is great and the stylization for the period is great. It can be a bit slow at time, I can never seem to hold all of my attention to it but when the plot thickens and things escalates, it's a wild and fun ride.",10,positive,positive
"I'm sorry but as a life long Star Wars fan (I saw the first episode the 2nd day out at the old Fox Theater in West Covina, CA), I just cannot stomach this poorly written and executed disaster. I was not a fan of Diego Luna in Rogue One as he has little to no screen presence and comes across like a scared kitty (my apologies to all you kitten lovers). He was the wrong person then and still is. This series is lacking anything remotely exciting and is so slow that I almost stopped watching after the first 3 episodes. Disney must slow down and take a close look at scripts and the actors used.  While using great cannon and set periods that closely match the originals, the overuse of British actors doesn't help it win over Americans because the English tend to OVER act and some scenes come across in this series in an almost Shakespearean manner. I just hope with the poor execution and assuming they are doing a season 2, I hope these things are taken into account.",7,neutral,positive
"... and if they're pretty white people with money, they jump to the front of the front of the line.  When things go wrong, a twist happens and they win again! And of course since something went wrong, the pineapple suite and the $1000 shot of 1942 Don Julio is on the house.  No obvious protagonist. No obvious antagonist. It's hard to root for the underdog good guy since when they fight against the system they become the winner bad guy, but then they lose.... Because surprise! They still aren't white and rich. And now things are worse.  Don't get psyched for happy endings unless a smirk from an egghole walking on a beach is a happy ending.",10,positive,positive
"Unfortunately as with GoT the creator took many liberties in terms of casting and story. I honestly find it weird how many of the characters were cast to be non-white while the game had all of them to be basically of European, Slavic or so descent. Geralt and Ciri were great I would say. Obviously Triss is just horrible but for me Yennefer was totally out of place. It just did not come through which pretty much broke some of her scenes. Obviously in the end the writing hurts the show much more with a generally rushed pace and not enough time to develop one-off characters and interactions. Perhaps each episode should have went with a certain character exploring the situation more. Overall, while The Witcher season one is definitely worth a watch it fails to reach the level of the games.",6,neutral,positive
"Wednesday was a really fun And intriguing show the mystery was great and really had me trying to investigate it figure it out, And the beautiful Jenna Ortega's performance was Phenomenal as always and really the best part of the show for me it's insane how much emotion and feelings she could convey through Wednesday's Eyes, And I'm sure her career will explode even more after This show and it'll for sure hold great things in the future maybe an Oscar who knows (Hopefully) she's definitely one of the most Talented Actress I've seen in a while and am rooting for her and For her to have even more success in her career, Anyway I'm not a reviewer just a fan but if you want to watch a really enjoyable show definitely watch this is a Great time all the way through, And I really hope we get a second season also which I'm sure it will seeing how great the ratings have been and this being in so many new Jenna Ortega Fans, Also it's really impressive that Wednesday only blinks around three times in the entire show and only smile a few times also, Anyway this is a 10/10 Show go watch it :)",6,neutral,positive

Peaky Blinders is probably one of the most underrated Television series of all time. It gives an insight into what life was like after WW1. If you like films or a series that is based on a true story then Peaky Blinders is the one for you. The series is based on a true story about the real peaky blinders who were bookmakers and had regular run ins with police and other authorities. The Peaky blinders series really fits its genre of crime. The codes and conventions are clearly displayed and used to a good effect. Thomas Shelby really fits the term of a true leader. He makes all the key decisions and always has a say in discussions.,10,positive,positive
"Wednesday is Tim Burton his young-adult take on the Addam's Family story and it shows. Everything about this show feels alive and kicking. From the surprisingly cool murder mystery story to the set designs, customes, music and even the faces of the actors, everything just works to bring the absurdity to life. Blending the over-the-top world of this spooky family with Burton's masterful macabre abilities feels like a masterstroke, quickly elevating this to one of Netflix their current top shows.  The support of castmembers such as Zeta-Jones and the original Wednesday Christina Ricci certainly helps, but it's young Jenna Ortega who steals the show effortlessly. Her ice-cold depiction of deeply sarcastic Wednesday Addams is of Antarctic-freeze levels and will leave you all warm and fuzzy when watching her bend her entire world to her dark and brooding will.  A must see for any Tim Burton fan and anyone who loves some dark comedy really. It's alive.",10,positive,positive
"I have a hard time rating this since it is so inconsistent both episode to episode and season to season. I'll talk about episode to episode first. Tone doesn't really match and certain episodes seem like side quests that aren't really connected. Some episodes are lightning quick all action well others are more of a slow burn. There will be a light hearted fun episode the then next episode is super serious. The season pacing doesn't follow the traditional 3 act pacing. It makes watching multiple episodes like a yo-yo. Production value is good and it is solidly acted. Dialogue is okay (most Star Wars dialogue isn't great).  Season one was a solid start (7-8 rating). There is a lot of groundwork being laid here. Tone episode to episode is uneven, but it doesn't detract too much and most episodes are entertaining  Season 2 was phenomenal (9-10). The season 2 finale was one of my 10-15 favorite episodes of any show ever. Early in the season it outlined the objective, set clear logical obstacles as season progressed, and characters used logic/reason to solve the problems. This season also had the best pacing and most even tone.  Season 3 is a mess(4-5). Grogo is back without any explanation of why. He can on demand use very powerful force powers without any training. Then in the next scene is a powerless hostage. Mandalorian who has always used ingenuity and logic to address obstacles suddenly is dumb and constantly needs to be rescued. This season also directly contradicts lore it established in seasons 1-2. Worst of all most episodes are actually pretty boring.",10,positive,positive
Finally a good original star wars story from Disney it has that feel of those old clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns and Pedro Pascal is great as the Mandalorian (just hope it's really him under that helmet),10,positive,positive
"A series bigger than the universe it is part of. Together with Rogue One, this story competes with the original trilogy ... and it is a TIE, pun intended. The story starts slow, meticulously placing the characters on the board and taking its time to play a perfect match. The show is the people vs the tyrant, about guerrilla warfare versus military intelligence and love vs duty. It starts cold, but it heats up and ends full of heart. It is awesome at portraying the feelings of characters on both sides, rebel and imperial. Regardless of the faction, each character is powerful in their own right, but each one is also fragile and fractured. As for the end, Andor is as powerful as Rogue One.",10,positive,positive
"It was watchable but I didn't love it.  I'm not sure just how involved Burton actually was with this project, it doesn't feel like he was massively involved because this series really didn't scream ""Burton-esque"" to me. He supposedly directed the series, but a few different directors' names pop up in the credits?  I was excited to see it when I found out Tim's name was attached to it, but it ended up being far too ""teeny high school drama"" for my liking.  I did like Jenna Ortega as Wednesday, I thought she portrayed the character well and made it her own. Uncle Fester was okay as well. And Thing, but, ya know, he's a hand. The casting for the rest of the Addams however, I didn't like; they just didn't capture the essence of the characters in my eyes.  This series had its moments, but as a whole I just didn't get what I was hoping for and was left a bit disappointed.",5,neutral,positive
"I seriously cannot fathom the low reviews on this show..  Nearly every single negative review is poorly written and all basically say the same exact thing...  ""Oh this is like the walking dead""  ""It's too long""  ""I'm upset and projecting my feelings over casting choices""  And yet every single one of them says  The production value is great, the acting is great, the sets and music are great..  But they give it a 1 star review because it's ""like the walking dead""..  Don't listen to these people, they've obviously never seen the walking dead..  They say ""it's like the walking dead"" about everything that is even remotely post apocalyptic..  If you want some boring arthouse movie or some foreign trash listen to the low reviewers..  This show is great..  Good acting, sets, cgi, plot, pacing..  And best of all it's just like the walking dead!! (It's not at all)",10,positive,positive

"The message of the Handmaids Tale is strong and important, especially now. It's well acted (for the most part). It's plot, on paper, sounds gripping... But amidst the gratuitous close ups of Junes face, The numerous dragged out scenes, And the confusing and downright frustrating decisions made by ALL the characters--to the point where most characters become borderline unlikable It all could possibly be forgiven if the show wasn't so damn slow.  I think about how much of a compelling story and characters arcs that were covered in 5 seasons of Breaking Bad... By the 5th season of Handmaids Tale it felt like only a handful of episodes of actual progress in the storyline had occurred, Its a shame for such a groundbreaking story that it has been written into the wind.",5,neutral,positive
"Started 2 season well then up to episode 6, just lost the plot. Nothing like the book. Characters are turned around. Location completrly wrong. Why call it Reacher and from the Lee Child's book if you are not going to tell the story from the book. The story in the book is better thought out and flows better, this second series is nothing like the book. They guy who plays Reacher is good and so are the other actors but why deviate from a good story and just make it a run of the mill good guys against bad guys. They have not done Lee Child proud with this take on his story. Too many changes, just call it something else but not a Reacher story.",10,positive,positive
"This is what fans of Reacher have been waiting years for. A practically perfect adaptation. Some minor missteps like the casting of Neagley and Roscoe's family heritage storyline being removed, which added to her character.  Alan Ritchson is a fantastic casting choice and buries the horrible memory of Tom Cruise's ridiculous puny version.  Go watch the show.  And finally, when are the second and third season coming out?",8,positive,positive
"I don't understand the big review score on this show. It's very much just meh imo. I don't hate the show, but it wasn't good either. I feel like most of the good reviews is just from the nostalgia. I really tried to enjoy is a Star wars, especially the 4-6th episode movies are amazing and have stood up very well. Episodes 1-3 was kind of meh, and episodes 7- 9 were just god awful. Thankfully there's really no reason to watch past 6 for plot comprehension purposes. Hopefully one day Disney can get back to making quality content over just pumping out as much as possible to try and boost the view counts and subs.   not really sure what's up with the 600 char min now, that's kind of why I had to go on a little rant just to hit the minimum.",10,positive,positive
"First, Jenna Ortega was amazing. Her performance upped my rating.  Overall, this was not bad, but definitely a YA thing.  I despised the casting of Gomez and Morticia. I also didn't get their vibe AT ALL. It was kind of gross.  The entire story was good, but it was less Addams Family and more....some reimagining that didn't quite make sense.  If you are a YA, you will love this. If you are older...you might scratch your head.  In the end, it was a decent watch. Thing was awesome. Jenna Ortega was awesome. The whole nevermore academy thing added a new layer to the story.  Bottom line....gen z will love this. Gen x appreciates it, but won't think twice about it.",8,positive,positive

Tim Burton is a genius in his presentation of Wednesday. Ortega was every it as good as Ricci in playing the character. I must admit, that at times it felt a bit too Potteresque, but not for long. I thought the sword scene was going to be a rip off of the sword of Gryffindor, but pleasantly it was not. I hope next season they fill out some of the other characters a bit more. Delving deeper into Bianca family problems might lead to another good story. Also, give me more bees. Cannot wait for next season. Please don't make us wait too long.",6,neutral,positive
"I NEVER review anything I watch, but after completing the last episode and I genuinely created this account specifically for the purpose of writing this review because I don't know if I have ever been as angry as I am now, at a show.  If you have ever waited on hold for tech support for three hours only to have the person tell you to unplug it then plug it back in again, then have your call drop... you may have already experienced something similar to watching this show.  I gave this two stars instead of one because the acting is actually really good! With the exception of Alexandria Daddario. I do not exaggerate at all when I say hers was likely the WORST acting I have ever seen in anything. 100% of her scenes feature her at atleast one point (but usually several/many points) slack jawed blank staring, and forcing words out as if she is a toddler learning to speak for the first time.. and I know, I know her whole thing is that she is in a life crisis and she is supposed to look confused and lost, but this is SO SO ridiculously cartoony and over done. I hate how this sounds as I type it but genuinely, If I did not know better I would think she was playing mentally impaired.  The writing throughout the show keeps you watching because the show starts with the finale scene which leads you to believe the ending will definitely be a twist. Then the show is SO anticlimactic you feel each episode you are getting closer to the twist ending. Suspenseful music even plays throughout the entire thing leading you to believe this is ALLL just build up for the last episode because of course nothing could be this meaningless .. then, sure as sh!+ there it is.. the MOST pointless MOST meaningless ending you will ever see in anything. Surely this is the point, and yes I do get that is the ""artistic appeal"" blah blah blah I'm sure someone would argue I just don't understand art, I do. I do. I just absolutely can not STAND stuff like this. If I watched it and was fully prepared to be disappointed by the ending I might have enjoyed it more. So, for any readers out there trying to decide if you're going to watch this or not I say; do it, but prepare for a let down!",5,neutral,positive
"I saw both ESB, and ROTJ in theaters. I have read hundreds of Star Wars novels since the late 80s. I watched the remastered OT when they came out, and liked some changes, and disliked others. Then, the prequel trilogy. They had good points, and bad points, and really, removing Jar Jar and adding a bit of believable chemistry between Hayden and Natalie would have helped tremendously. Rogue One was decent, Solo was not that bad, and then. Then we have the new ones. Someone, a lot of someones, need to be fired and barred from ever having any say in anything that goes onto a local news television channel.  Then, The Mandalorian comes along. It's like Disney realized how badly they screwed up, and let someone write a Star Wars universe based show that actually LIKES Star Wars, and wanted to tell a story about a previously unknown character making his way through life five years after the fall of the Empire. And it works. This show has everything that the fans who grew up watching non Disney Star Wars could want. I do realize that as I write this, we are only two episodes in, but, every single thing that I have seen fits into the thirty five years of Star Wars history pre Disney. And it is wonderful.",10,positive,positive

I am absolutely stunned that a Disney+ series has become T H I S bada$$ ???????? and that there is such a difference between season one and season two (to me at least)...  The May 6 episodes really left me breathless at the heartbreaking emotional toll that a rebellion takes on every level of society... whether that be the innocent rebellion or even several of the imperialist characters that were actually traumatized by the horrific violence and atrocities that were committed. It was brilliant how it puts you emotionally ""there"" to feel and experience an actual rebellion and all that goes into it...",10,positive,positive
"Okay whattttt?! I was not expecting this to be that good. But I was hooked immediately. The whole production is so good. I only wish Netflix had released it in October because it would be so perfect for Halloween. Tim Burton is a phenomenal director, and every cast member is perfect for their roles. Jenna plays Wednesday so well, I saw an interview where she spoke about taking direction from Burton. You can tell she really enjoyed playing the character, and her commitment shows on screen. The ""high school"" Netflix show trope has run its course so many times before, it feels stale, but this is so obviously different and fresh.",8,positive,positive

"This is a great show if you can get past the first three episodes. They're not bad, just confusing. The story basically has three protagonists, but their individual stories are told in different time periods. If you've read the books (I haven't), this might be apparent, but the show doesn't reveal that fact to the uninformed viewer until episode four. Once you figure that out, however, the story becomes addictive. The production values are great, the acting is good, and the special effects for the most part are well done. It's certainly not perfect; I think that some of the acting and poor dialog makes it seem a little cheesy at times. That said though, I can't wait for season two.",6,neutral,positive
"I like Taylor Sheridan. I own Hell or High Water and Wind River and think they are great films. I saw Yellowstone and went ahead and purchased the first season on the basis of him and the glowing reviews.  My god it is just so bad. It's so wooden, the characters are unlikeable and terribly cliched. The patriarchal minimal talking dad, the lawyer son, the tearaway Daddy's girl.  Everything is painted with such a broad sloppy brush that Bob Ross would be embarrassed.  Random events happen to generate tension, the endless whining from the Native Americans becomes intolerable and the attempts at drama are laughable and cringe inducing.  Case in point is the unlikeable daughter. Portayed to be this wild neurotic alcoholic hate filled individual but when the plot needs it she can be this fearless businesswoman and 'do anything' fixer.  Really? Can you be a respected business woman living in a bottle? Do you need to, I don't know, knuckle down and do a bit of work occasionally. Oh no, not in this world. The writer needed a certain character and just fashioned it without any thought behind the construction of that character.  One minute parading naked in a horse bath because she's so self absorbedly crazy and 'bad ass' and black of heart but literally a few hours later laughing in the golden hour as she watches people try to lasso a training prop.  I guess earlier she needed to be wild but right now she needs to be at ease as the Montana evening breeze ruffles her hair. It's all so contrived and idiotic.  No single character in the show is likeable (which I guess is one kind of writing achievement) yet all expect to be venerated for being so cowboy or so Indian or so proud or so female.  It really is just a pretensious bloated mess. It's got all the product placement tie ins. The big hats and big trucks but ultimately it is a huge shiny belt buckle holding up a pair of $1 dollar jeans.",10,positive,positive
"I've watched all 8 episodes of 1st season. The show keeps gettin better after each episode. If you are lost after 2 episodes you clearly are .... hmmm or like the critics You should watch it again before going forward because each next episodes explains a lot that was unknow in previous ones. The witcher story is not going to make sense for moste people as mose people IQ is belowe average sadly. Example - one episode to the next and Yennefer story is told 30 years after but the people just dont't get it... and are lost. I read some critics reviews and it is just so laughalble how 'stupid (low IQ)' they are ( I didn't want to use this word). It is not 10/10 show but i gave it 10 becouse of the low IQ people frustrated and giving it 1 after 2 episodes. The cast is spot on and Cavill is phenomenall as Geralt. Freya as Ciri is very good as well, Anya is getting better with each episode and in the last one is just badass very good. Production value is top notch, only sometimes storytelling is to rushed but I can understand - the first season is only to intoduce the three main characters and in my opinion it is made very good. Overall It is very good show, don't compare it to GoT as it is nonsense. The wither is so much more magic and action... Let just say that in GoT the magic got to light some torches. lol :) In the wither the magic done by one individual can burn the armies :D",10,positive,positive

"I've been a Star Wars fan ever since I was Six years old. It was and always has been my favorite movie franchise. Even though my favorite movie from The Saga is Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith, I hold a special place in my heart for Rogue One.  But since the acquisition of Lucasfilm by Disney in 2014. Star Wars as a brand has suffered from ups and downs with their projects. Mostly downs.  As a Star Wars fan, I want the franchise to succeed and thrive, it's what all Star Wars fans want. And I truly believe Star Wars can be successful again, in other words, I have hope. If there's one thing I've learned from the Original Trilogy and George Lucas, is to have hope.  Which brings me to Andor. Since Disney bought Lucasfilm, their best projects have been in my opinion: Rouge One and a few of the animation series (The Clone Wars and The Bad Batch).  But after watching Andor and processing the final scenes, I would argue that Andor is among the best written Star Wars shows of recent years. It is simply a fantastic story. One that has brought me back hope that Star Wars can be successful and perfect again. Every aspect in the series is top level: Set Decorations, Costume Design, VFX, the cinematography and much more I'll delve into.  To those who have commented that this series is not true Star Wars; because it does not feature some of the elements, we all know and love: The lightsaber fights, the concept of ""The Force"", the fight between Jedi and Sith. I'll keep it simple: I believe George Lucas has built A massive universe that can contain multiple stories from different aspects. A world where we can explore many stories that don't necessarily need to have the elements mentioned above.  And though I'm a huge fan of these elements that make Star Wars so unique, I also enjoyed the story I was given in Andor.  The biggest aspect I've enjoyed in Andor, and the biggest difference from the original trilogy. Was the complex morality of the characters: In the Original Trilogy it is very clear who are the bad guys and good guys - The empire, Darth Vader and the Death Star represent evil while Luke Skywalker, Lea and Han Solo, the rebel alliance represent good.  Later in the prequel trilogy, the lines of good and bad are blurred, The Jedi Order as seen in the trilogy are imbedded in politics and do not show support to Anakin Skywalker, ""The Chosen one"". And later on, when Anakin turns to the dark side and betrays the jedi, it shatters the image we were given of the man he once was.  In Andor, we see how both fighting sides are not so moral, even though the empire is shown to be more intimidating. Some of the rebel figures do not show much compassion or regard to human casualties. Saw Gerrera, Luthen Rael, even the titular character himself, Cassian Andor, are all shown to put in danger others if it means saving the ones they love and themselves.  In the case of Cassian, he does what needs to be done to accomplish the mission - a character trait that helps understand his character in Rogue One much better.  I guess by showing as so many unethical characters in the series, the purpose of the series is to show how cruel people can be in reality, not every person can be moral and full of heart like Qui Gon Jinn and Luke Skywalker. The world, even the one in Star Wars can be full of Luthen Rael, Saw Gerrera, and Cad Bane (who doesn't appear in the show but is another great example of characters who are not moral in this universe).  Before I speak of the acting, I have to mention the soundtrack by Nicholas Britell, the composer of Succession. The theme music is so powerful and chilling. Every time I hear Cassian's theme, named Past/Present suite I ger immediate goosebumps.  When it comes to acting, aside of the brilliant performances of every single actor, the writing is perfect. Just imagine the type of writing we as fans had to endure back in 2019: during The Rise of Skywalker when Poe Dameron says ""somehow Palpatine has returned"". Compare that with every single monologue a character has got in the series, and it just shows why the screenplay is the most important part in a project.  As for the acting itself, the best performances were by Diego Luna and Stellan Skarsgård. I was always invested in Cassian Andor as a character since Rogue One, and getting a show cantering around him, and the events that lead up to Rogue One was just a joy to watch. Luna is an incredible actor and I enjoyed his performance throughout the whole series.  Stellan Skarsgård was amazing, the emotional range he delivers throughout the series was powerful. He gives you the chilling vibe of a man who delivers his life to fight an oppressive regime, yet will risks many lives in order for his plans to work. The monologue he delivers in season 1 episode 10 was a powerful speech that will go down as one of the best speeches in the Star Wars universe.  In Conclusion, as a Star Wars fan, I have hope that with the effort and dedication put in Andor, the franchise will learn to make similar projects, and be able to be successful again and loved by the community. There is always A New Hope.",10,positive,positive
Here in tv show is just a Woker. Omg this tv show is bad. Armors are like cheep plastic story is lame all this 10 reviews are paid by Writer Lauren who shouod nevef touch Witcher i m saying this as Polish.,6,neutral,positive
"I'm being genuinely generous here, because I was so very disappointed with the turn this show took. It was just so... weird? This is my first form of encounter with The Witcher and I get that people who are familiar with the world are able to follow the confusing timelines etc, but what's the point of the show then? It's supposed to please the fans as well as introduce the world to the new audience, and that was executed rather poorly; no world building, no answers whatsoever, magic has no clear rules, plotlines are tangled in such an uneccessarily weird way (and I'm not stupid, obviously I managed to piece it together after some time but it was very tedious nonetheless), the dialogue is full of cliche lines and there's a bunch of random characters in each episode you fell zero connection to by the time the episode ends. Cavill does his best, he was a good choice and even Chalotra and Allan have done a decent jobs, but there is very little arc to any of the characters and therefore you don't feel anything for them in the end. Everything is just so... sloppy. The best episode was the third one and after, it just all went downhill to me. It's far from being terrible, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't have any charisma of its own, everything is half-baked and there is just so much to work on for the second season and such a high rating baffles me. Maybe it's me, but I couldn't care less for the most of the characters. There is still so much potential but it has to be handled properly for the second season. The only proper thing is the Toss A Coin To Your Witcher which has been on my repeat for days now.",8,positive,positive
"The Mandolorian gets a lot of things right about Star Wars. It has the look and feel of the universe created by George Lucas, while also expanding its universe and paying hommage to the vast amount of expanded material. It walks a fine line between the now three established movie universes, while also including elements from the animated series. Visually it is a feast for the eyes, with incredible visual and practical effects, and gorgeous sets and costumes. There is also plenty of fan service, although it is rarely jarring. But if only the writing was a little better.  There is no character development to speak of, there is very little tension, and it is tonally very inconsistent. Almost every episode feels disjointed, as if remnants of various scattered ideas for that episode were just thrown together. Rarely does an episode for this show have a satisfying set up or conclusion and there are very little surprises or twists. Many plot points are often left unused, as if they were elements of scrapped ideas for that episode. The main character feels invincible and solves every situation by just shooting his way out, which severely undermines any chance for suspense. The main antagonist Moff Gideon, played by the fantastic Giancarlo Espesito, is given very little to do and the show does not do enough to build him up as a credible threat. The one-off adventure in every episode also feels like a dated fomat for this day and age, in a time when most shows construct larger narratives across multiple episodes.  The show is intended to be a mix between a western and a pulpy space opera, but it never really commits to its western angle, which is a real shame. It also becomes apparent after the first few episodes, what a problem it is to have your main character always be masked. Plus the writers clearly struggle with writing any dialogue for any of the characters. While all these problems could be forgiven for a first season, they are just as present in the second season. How is it possible that a show with such a big budget, has such weak writing? The show has yet to produce an episode with a plot that rises above (or equals) that of a saturday morning cartoon... and that is a very low bar.",7,neutral,positive

"Hulu's The Handmaid's Tale is a beautiful surprise. The scene that sold me to this show was in the first episode - 'Offred'. I do not want to spoil that but when you watch it, you will agree with me that it is clearly a masterfully directed piece of art. (SHOUT OUT TO REED MORANO) This show IS GREAT! Honestly, I am not overrating the show but it truly is a must-see show that I hope will continue to climb up to its greatness. People who gave it a negative review clearly felt it HIT TOO CLOSE TO REALITY! Well they will have to deal with it.  Watch all 10 episodes and you will not regret even a single second of it. It deservedly won 8 Primetime Emmy Awards and I hope the critics also think the same about the show!!!",9,positive,positive
"I had a 9 rating before, after the 5th season, i dropper it to 6. First season was good, it continued slow but had a nice story, good cast, nice cinematography, good soundtrack. Then It got Even slower!! 6 episodes could be easily squeezed into one. But the 5th season...a complete disaster, a waste of time. Waiting for over a year, for a lousy season that had no story, moderate acting, tons of stupid meaningless explosions & no result whatsoever!! I won't be waiting for season 6 and i won't watch it either.",10,positive,positive
"The show was great and Jenna Ortega did an excellent job as Wednesday!  She looked great! The hair style is better than the old movie Wednesday! And that thing about her serious, unemotional eyes was perfect! I'm sure there were plenty of bloopers she had to laugh when trying to do the unemotional non-smile, but she did pull it off so well in the end. I am pleased with her part as Wednesday! I was disappointed in some actor choices, such as Gomez, Morticia and Pugsly. Gomez & Morticia were not quite right in personality/actions. But the story was real good, the effects were good etc. I really do hope to see more episodes come out.",10,positive,positive
"Not much to say, this is pure starwars. Haven't looked forward to, or enjoyed, watching a show this much for so long. Simply amazing  It hits the sweet spot which makes the original star wars films so magical, which other shows and films failed to hit.  Love it. Keep them coming please, don't change a thing.",2,negative,positive
"Dialogue and scenes challenge viewer to follow the tempo and remember the characteristics of each character .

Appealing season1 show with further potential on momentum and faster/concentrated plot .",10,positive,positive
"To me this is the best Star Wars spin off by far. Great production with great one off stories within the overall tale. Mando is one cool dude with a side to him that surprised me but was heartwarming to see. Great characters, great stories and a great show. This is the wild west in a far far away galaxy. Long may it continue..",8,positive,positive
"This is just the right show for you. Odd-looking actors, amusingly delivering portentous but ""gritty"" evil nonsense for angry, low-IQ audiences who have long tired of the Mitchell brothers on Eastenders. Neither artistic nor realistic, Peaky Blinders never even climbs the first ladder of plain old entertainment, either. Sadly for the BBC, pretension does not equal quality, or pace.",8,positive,positive
"As the title says - the show is no longer the same. In Season 1 and Season 2, the show has a western feel to it. An almost silent protagonist, Bounty Hunting, Adventure and Shootouts. The show largely keeps that tone for the most part throughout season 1 and 2. There are a few parts that aren't so good, but for the most part, the show is solid.  That show we all loved in season 1 and 2 no longer exists. Instead we get several episodes in Season 3 that have NOTHING to do with The Mandalorian, that doesn't feel at all like the show we originally were watching and now in the last few episodes, the main character of the show, The Mandalorian (Din Djarin) has taken a backseat in his own series. He's a side character who barely speaks and lets others take the lime light. He barely does anything and if he does, it's quickly followed up by him failing and needing to be protected or being outdone by others. This has happened more than a dozen times now in only a few episodes, from being captured to getting beat up, to failing to fire on a rogue droid before someone else, he feels more like the plots tool to make the new characters in the show feel more impressive than they are. The flimsy rules for things that were established in a previous season are now thrown out the window to prop up side characters or, well, now they feel like the main characters again with the Mandalorian taking a backseat. Like the Darksaber we see on the new posters. Pointless and now used as prop to make others stand out. Forget all the subtext that he was to be someone special in this new series, nope. It's all been thrown out the window.  The show went from one of the better things on TV in season 1 and 2 to one of the worst things on TV in season 3, that now feels like something The CW would spit out.",10,positive,positive
"I downgraded from 9 to 3 after the release of s2. Having watched the first season and enjoyed it, I certainly did not sign up for some teeny melodrama with the usual hallmarks of liberal progressive screen play, where of course we must turn a straight girl into a lesbian and stuff a random sex scene in to make the point.  I guess Joel represents everything wrong with modern society. A straight middle aged guy who's toxic masculinity is a stain on the apocalyptic world.  What a pity, season 1 was gritty, tense and well put together. Season 2 is on a downward spiral like the rest of the creative industries we endure.",7,neutral,positive

Murray Bartlett, Jennifer Coolidge, Connie Britton, and the entire cast delivered Emmy-worthy performances. Loved it!",10,positive,positive
"The writers went full game of thrones with this and ruined the last season...I guess the tragic passing of Helen McCrory meant they had to change alot of what had already been written because she would have had a major role to play in the climax of the story and sadly she left us before finishing filming. It felt rushed and there were too many long montages of nothing to pad the time out...every season before this last one was impeccably written and directed.  And the destruction of Arthur from tough guy to smack head is so sad, they ruined his ending...I'd be fuming if I was Paul Anderson.",9,positive,positive
"Finally, a Star Wars addition which elevates. It's slower, far less action driven, yet more suspenseful as a result. The characters have layers and complex motivations. I especially love the weird master/sub relationship forming with the ISB commander and her weird stalker who lives with his mother. It's full of odd details and threads.  This show also feels true to the core themes and style of the original trilogy. In some ways it's more effective. We feel a strong sense of oppression, ambiguous ethics, dirty hands, and meaningful formation of a rebellion. It's a refreshing change and a more mature Star Wars.",6,neutral,positive
"At first I didn't like it, cringy, uncomfortable and also slow. My wife wanted us to continue so we did and then it got better... I decided to not feel second hand pain/shame/etc... And it got fun.",7,neutral,positive
"Loved the first season ,but have given up after 2 episodes of the season 2. Very weak and the tree monster character was laughable. Netflix trying to make money out of mediocrity. I suppose that is their business model!!",1,negative,positive
"Started out as an interesting and tense take on a dark comedy, and then it soon became clear that the creators weren't entirely sure of the tone they were going for. Odd juxtaposition of establishing shots, building score and often mundane dialogue. Different is good, but not at the detriment of substance. Would've been a better film if it leaned into the thriller aspects or the black comedy, but struggles to balance both, and the disappointing finale shoehorns the character development that was missing from the the rest of the season. I think it's worth a watch, but if you start to feel like your attention is waning, it's a good point to stop. There's no unfurling mystery with a nice payoff... I actually forgot about what's hinted in the first scene.",7,neutral,positive

"Season 2 is nothing short than outstanding! Candy for the eyes, a weird kind of suspense throughout the episodes and a stellar cast! (I actually find Jennifer Coolidge a little overrated, but Aubrey Plata, Adam DiMarco and F Murray Abraham BRING it! It is that type of show where I simply can not wait for the next episode to be online. Where as in Season 1 some of the storylines became a little over the top towards the end I find that in Season 2 all plots build up nicely and suspenseful. It makes you wanna got to Italy so bad; on the other hand the horror of what passion, emotions and mankind itself can do is frightening to say the least!",10,positive,positive
"The Mandalorian hits it out of the park by miles, and consequently puts the more recent Star Wars feature films to shame. You know when a certain movie or series has that special ""something""? Well.. this has that. The series is driven by a single main character, with superb costume design, cinematography, story-line, and casting. Werner Herzog was perfect for the role he played. Be prepared to see a lot of baby Yoda action figures owned by fans. ""This is the way.""",10,positive,positive
"Well I started to watch it just because I saw it in 2-3 of my friends recommendations, and since I am on some kind of isolation, I gave it a try.  First episode.. or even season, was extra boring. I couldn't even hold my focus for 10 minutes. Idea was interesting, but was kinda boring.. in the beginning... but I didn't stop watching.  Somewhere between half of first season or season two even, it got interesting.. but it got soo soo broken... Man, I don't know how a person who came up with this idea lives with himself... I can't.. watching this deeply hurts me, but thanks God this is not reality and I can stop and take a break... This is really messed up and unfair, and broken... Interesting... but broken.",10,positive,positive
It's a decent show. I had to give it another try as the first episode is excellent and then it changes into a very slow burn. I gave it another go.  It's not so much about the action but the relationship and the realisation of living in this new world.  It's nothing that hasn't been done before. It's TWD and I stopped watching that as it turned into a repetitive melodrama.  It kept me occupied but it's not something I'd recommend or rave about.  As others have said SKIP episode 7. COMPLETE waste of time.  ...  It's a decent show. I had to give it another try as the first episode is excellent and then it changes into a very slow burn. I gave it another go.

"Having read all or most of the Reacher novels, I was first surprised at the Musclebound specimen they cast to play him. First departure from the Book. Also, it is taking 8 episodes to tell the Story of one Book. Thats stretching things out a bit. I think they could do 2 Books in one Season without jeopardizing the Story integrity. Entertaining but not compelling...",5,neutral,positive
"Obviously I have prefaced this with the word read. I bought this book, and that would be the book written by Ms Atwood, for my seventeen year old daughter only a few months ago. Who knew, its now transcribed to digital media.  And so it should be.  Not quite like the book but close. The Black and Jewish questions for example were not addressed by the producers, which is a shame as it further cemented the casual bigotry within the Christian dystopian universe of the book.  This is a political polemic written in 1985 by a woman who had her finger on a very specific pulse. She predicted an imagined future within a Christian society that is demonstrably, and indeed tragically, evident within some Muslim societies today, as it was of course back then. So this is a mirror, a juxtaposition.  I am not going to wax lyrical on the merits of cinematography, as others have already done so. What I am going to say is that as an educator this effort is worthy of compulsory viewing for young women. Some men will not like it. Many Christians will not like it, nor should they.  This production is an exceptionally good peace of work by the production crew and actors but most of all by the writers. Remarkable, awesome work, and thank you.  As a footnote and having now watched episode ten in the first series I really, really like the negative reviews. The illiteracy, the frequent politically biased and often misogynistic sexism, the quiet apologists and, indeed in some cases, the overt Christian bigotry prevalent in so many negative reviews is just wonderful. If you doubt the veracity of Atwood's principle supposition then the negative reviews are also a must read, and if you do, pause and think again. I have no doubt that many of these negative reviewers would feel quite at home in Gilead.",10,positive,positive
"Peaky Blinders is a brilliant show. It's story line is incredibly well thought out, with dramatic twists and turns in each episode.",9,positive,positive
"The writing and show is aimed at the upper-middle class. And it's perfectly done. You probably won't get the subtle psychological nuances if you don't care about human behavior at all social classes. It's a perfect piece of art if you live a slightly similar lifestyle. Narcissism, addiction, Machiavellianism are rampant themes. If you don't like human psychology, watch your NASCAR race, reality show or soap opera.  All actors do a great job. Not one is inauthentic.  I think the haters never lived on the US coasts or understood affluent culture. You don't have to be wealthy and sophisticated to like his show, as long as you're not fully ignorant of today's culture, norms, values, and problems.  If you still want our society to wind back to the Leave It to Beaver Days; you'll hate the reality of the show or just plain not get it.  This is better than Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad. Because it's so societal-current.",7,neutral,positive

Some people says ""it's same with other netflix series Sabrina"" yes it too similar but in my opinion, Wednesday is better. References are good too.

"Gotta hand to Burton, Gough, and Miller. This show was really good. The best way I can describe this show is a mix between a crime/noir type show mixed with horror, and a touch of Sci-Fi. It does have elements of being a coming-of-age type story, but it legit has its own identity which distinct itself from other shows like Stranger Things, or Supernatural.  The show would not work at all if they didn't nail the lead, which they did! Jenna Ortega is perfect casting as Wednesday. Her character is meant to be stoic, emotionless, and sometimes cold, but there are several subtle moments where she expresses fear, sadness, and even a bit of joy. She play's that role perfectly and leads the show with an Iron Fist. Emma Meyers was great as well! She was adorable and was a great addition and played off of Ortega really nicely. Percy White, Joy Sunday, Jamie McShane all did wonderfully, and I look forward to seeing their character progression moving forward.  I also really love the stage design and costume design. There's so much story telling you can see coming through the town of Jericho, and through Nevermore. Creepy, Ghoulish, Gothic is the aesthetic and I'm all for it.  And I gotta hand to Danny Elfman, his music fit right in with the series and played very nicely with what the show was capturing. So many tracks stood out to me. Well Done!  Once again, this show was really good! I think this Season really stands on its own, but I look forward to whatever Season 2 has to offer. I recommend it.  Solid B.",8,positive,positive
"Those who've given this bad reviews are constantly claiming it's trying to be Game of Thrones. It's not. It is a dark fantasy, but the magic is consistent as is, for the first season, the storytelling. It's its own world and it's a good one. I never knew about the Witcher until I saw the trailers and then buzzed through the season. Not a bad performance and Yennefer and Geralt are the primary characters. Henry Cavil shows his acting chops and the rest of the cast is really well done. There is one dragon, and it's nothing like the beasts from GOT. This dragon is more like a cousin of Smaug, and the more classical dragons. Well worth watching.",10,positive,positive

"Episode 6 delivers! The show is well written, well acted, no pointless CGI just to have CGI, it doesn't need to talk about the Force, characters aren't safe and it's suspenseful. It doesn't try too hard and rests on the actors portraying the store. We'll done so far!  As of late Rogue One, in my opinion, is the best release under Disney and this keeps the same tone of story over CGI. It shows the division of the galaxy between the oppressed and the oppressors without distinguishing between good and evil. It blurs the lines of who's right or wrong. It shows even the rebels and the people within the empire aren't always that different.",10,positive,positive

"Couldn't sleep so I turned on the TV. Looking for something interesting, nothing really jumped out at me, then I found Reacher. At first, I thought it was a movie that had been out awhile and I had passed it up previously. When I read the details of the movie I discovered it was new, 2022 movie with actors I was not familiar with. Ended up binge watching the miniseries and throughly enjoyed it! The plot is a familiar one, but this was not a formula type movie. Script is fresh, plot is exciting and the acting very good. It is an action movie, which isn't my favorite genre but, I really loved this movie.",4,negative,positive
"I went into The Last of Us Season 2 with high expectations after the gripping storytelling and emotional depth of the first season. Unfortunately, this follow-up stumbles more than it shines and suffers from the same storytelling mistakes that marred the original game.  The pacing felt uneven, with long stretches of meandering subplots that failed to build the tension or expand the world meaningfully. Characters that were once compelling now feel sidelined or, worse, out of character. Some key moments that should have been impactful came across as forced, almost rushed, as if checking boxes rather than letting the story breathe naturally.  Visually, the series still holds up, with strong cinematography and well-designed sets that capture the bleakness of its world. But stunning visuals can't save a script that too often feels bloated and disconnected.  It's a shame to see such strong potential diluted by poor narrative choices and uneven execution. Here's hoping the next season finds its footing again.",10,positive,positive
"The casting for his is so strange. CZJ is as gorgeous as ever, but fails to evoke the right Morticia vibes. Without the quirky mannerisms and innocently self-righteous tone, this Morticia is all dry and no quirk.  Let's forget about Gomez going from half Latino to full, he now has a NewYoRican accent, has gained 100 lbs and lost all of his weird humor. Wednesday is doing what she can with this role-doing a good job with the dead-pan humorlessness Wednesday is defined by, but again, there is no underlying quirky juice to make her at all funny. She does things that are funny from time to time, but the jokes fall flat because her character delivers with a kind of anger that goes a little too deep.  I think if you're not familiar with the original show, or the Sonnenfeld film, you probably won't mind all this, but for me, it's just not my cup of poison.",7,neutral,positive

"First of all, I'm done with a lot of the Netflix series which are written and constructed in a soap opera kind of way. Have always been a fan of HBO series and this one lives up to its legacy!  Season one and two both start with how the story ends, but the mystery of how this came to be leaves you as soon as the guests arrive. I once read a review of why shawshank redemption is such a great movie, even though it doesn't tick all the theoretical boxes. Basically you just love spending time with these beloved characters and atmosphere. The same applies to the white lotus.  There's a surprise around every corner, the holiday setting is mesmerising and just like its character development which is fresh and very well written (both verbal and non verbal are very well done) , even the holiday atmosphere progresses and pulls you in deeper as the season develops. Dialogue and characters are very natural and no one lingers to speak their mind. Topics that need to be addressed, are not stalled by switching to another scene like Netflix does so very often. Plus, every now and then, there are these scenes that take everything to the next level. For example (relax, no spoilers ahead) the scene in S1, last episode where the manager is being the perfect host in slow motion with the classical music in the background, or the girl singing a song behind the piano in season 2. Just amazing! Mike White is a genius!  Not sure about the awards the show has won, but the soundtrack (and score) should definitely win a few! It's mesmerising, sometimes surreal, warm, surprising, exciting and it definitely adds to the overall story development.  Okay, it's not for everyone. Then again, what is?",1,negative,positive
"The Handmaid's Tale is the TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood's dystopian novel of a right wing religious takeover of the USA that subjugates women. While beautifully produced, the two biggest problems of the series are the tortuously slow pace and the painfully boring performance of Elizabeth Moss in the leading role. Being one of the show's executive producers may account for her casting but she's five to eight years too old for the role which is about a woman being exploited for her fertility. The other major problem is that ""The Handmaid's Tale"" was a masterpiece of understatement and brevity. In trying to drag the story out over multiple seasons, the producers have been forced to go off on uninteresting tangents that did not exist in the book and slooow the pace of show down to an aggravating crawl. Do we really need to see endless scenes of Offred (Moss) climbing the stairs going into her room, slowly taking of her garb, all the while alternating between her three default expressions, dazed and angry, dazed and stricken and dazed and confused? Relieved by brief sequences of action where the story actually moves forward, insert the above in almost every other scene and that's the gist of the show.  If you're a fan of the book, the only way to watch this show is on fast forward. A better title for this series would have been ""The Handmaid's Snail.""",9,positive,positive
"The Dutton family (the father, three sons, and a daughter) has philosophical, positional, and financial differences. The father (Kevin Costner as John Dutton) is a resolute leader, and his children share his determination and loyalty, but differ on the means to solutions. One son (Luke Grimes as Cory Dutton) finds himself outside the clan; but when his family loyalty is tested, he proves himself but at great expense.  Taylor Sheridan (Wind River, Hell or High Water, and Sicario) has done it again (creating a very interesting story with great action). His characters seem so real; and the dilemmas they face are so complex, but understandable. You actually feel Cory's pain when he is torn between his wife (and her Native American relatives) and his family. S1 E1 has a very emotional scene (Cory and his wife) that no one will dismiss; it's so real and well-acted.  Finally, no one does a better job presenting a gun fight than Taylor Sheridan. Taylor knows guns and he knows what happens when guns are fired. The gunfight in Wind River was exceptional, and Mr. Sheridan presents the same authenticity in Yellowstone.",10,positive,positive
"The 4/10 is an overall score of season 1,2 and 3. Season 1 was a great 8/10, season 2 extremely disappointing as there was too much talking and not enough action 3/10. Season 3 dispute many fans of season 1 saying the same as me, have not ramped things up. It's so boring. 3/10.  I actually quite like the Tom Cruise films of Reacher, but saying that, Tom Cruise is not a Jack Reacher. Maybe a smaller Brother (much smaller) that he never knew he had. Alan Ritchin is exactly how I see Jack Reacher from the novels. So the series is becoming so disappointing.  Maybe it's time to ditch the series and give him some films instead so that they can put in more action in a 2 hour movie than we see in this near 7-8 hour bore fest.",7,neutral,positive

"The trailer made it look intriguing. The main actors are also part of the lure as I enjoyed Pedro in the Mandalorian and Bella in GOT. Chernobyl was done very well and honestly thats the bar of my expectations. And, since I thought the walking dead was really good until about season 6 I figured maybe this would be on par. So, it was anticipation that had me hoping this would be good. Such a let down. Tbh, I have a feeling this is going to drag as we all keep hoping it's going to get better but it won't...  Two episodes in, the quality of TV has gone down tremendously if you think this is well done. It's not breaking bad, stranger things or any of those tops shows. 9.4? I think in a year it's going to be a low 6 at best. The acting isn't that great, the writing is horrible, the cgi is eh, has a cheap feel to it like some family show on cm or something.  I didn't want to be hasty in my review but it's been challenging to get through the first two episodes. It sucks to watch new show after new show lower the bar.  Edit* Just watched Episode 3, while I personally cringe at homo characters making out on screen as that's not very pleasant to endure, I really enjoyed the rest of the episode. Never would have expected that from Nick Offerman (Parks and Rec) and I really enjoyed Murray Bartlett in The White Lotus. But, they brought entertainment to the episode, it was good. So, it went up 1 star for me.",10,positive,positive
"Andor stands out as a remarkable entry in the Star Wars universe, delivering a mature and gripping narrative that sets it apart from its predecessors. This prequel to ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" dives deep into the origins of Cassian Andor, offering fans a thrilling and nuanced look at the early days of the Rebel Alliance. From the outset, ""Andor"" captivates with its sophisticated storytelling. The series deftly explores the moral complexities of rebellion, presenting characters who are richly developed and deeply human. Diego Luna shines as Cassian Andor, delivering a performance that is both intense and emotionally resonant. His portrayal brings depth and gravitas to the character, making Cassian's journey compelling and relatable. The writing in ""Andor"" is top-notch, with a narrative that is both intricate and engaging. The series avoids the typical clichés often found in the genre, opting instead for a more grounded and realistic approach. This is a story of espionage and sacrifice, where the stakes feel incredibly high and the consequences of actions are keenly felt. Each episode builds tension masterfully, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. Visually, ""Andor"" is stunning. The production values are exceptional, with cinematography that captures the gritty, lived-in feel of the Star Wars universe. The attention to detail in the set design, costumes, and special effects is impeccable, creating a world that is both immersive and believable. The themes explored in ""Andor"" are timely and thought-provoking. The series delves into the cost of freedom and the ethical dilemmas faced by those who fight for it. It doesn't shy away from showing the darker aspects of rebellion, making it a more mature and layered narrative that resonates with a wide audience. In conclusion, ""Andor"" is a stellar addition to the Star Wars saga. Its mature storytelling, complex characters, and high production values make it a must-watch for fans and newcomers alike. This series not only enriches the Star Wars lore but also stands as a powerful and poignant narrative in its own right.",10,positive,positive
Needs tighter pacing. Plot needs to follow books EXACTLY! Needs a more existential feel. Reacher is weary and cynical after the huge number of fights he his has been in as a career MP and the 150+ cases he has worked. He is skeptical of everyone until he has had a chance to evaluate them. Yet the lead plays him like some kind of savant.,10,positive,positive
"The writing, the acting, the camera work, sets . . . EVERYTHING . . . AND a friendly dick pic as well to warm the cockles of my heart. I was expecting some soapy nonsense with canned laughter and instead found writing with depth and complexity AND an interesting murder mystery, which, in opening scenes suggest one thing, but could turn out to be something else entirely.  I have always admired Steve Zahn and his performance here is excellent. Same goes for Connie Britton. Not a weak link anywhere in the cast.  I was happily surprised. Really actually amazed. Looking forward to next episode. Talented work is always welcome.",8,positive,positive
"The latest season is terrible.  I don't quite know what's happened to so many of Taylor Sheridan's shows. Is it that he no longer cares? Is it that he's over-extended himself? Is it that he has been pushed out of the writing and show-running process? I don't know, but I've noticed a pattern: all of them are worse.  ""Yellowstone"" was always a soap opera, but it was a very good one for the first three seasons, and pretty good in the fourth. The fifth season is insultingly bad.  I feel like I could draw on any moment in the first episode of season five as an example, but let's go with the least dramatic: a bunch of Montana's finest try to catch some horse thieves. They have -- for some reason -- a Little Bird helicopter at their disposal for this purpose (normally such equipment is reserved for special forces, but okay). These agents corral the horse thieves into a river, where they are met by what appears to be the entire Canadian Mounties force on the other side of the river. There, the brave Montanans go out of their way to insult the Canadians (among other things, calling them ""sheep"") before returning triumphantly in what appears to be an otherwise meaningless scene.  The rest of the season so far follows this nonsense. It's just dumb.",9,positive,positive

"Cringeworthy characters and awkward situations with biting dialog and observations in Season 1 were a spot-on commentary on our present moment. It was also refreshing that, despite their shallow narcissism, each character displayed a human side and weakness in the end, which saved them from being only representations of their class, gender and racial stereotypes. Mike White is obviously very familiar with the Connecticut-Hamptons upper class and their verbiage - overall, Season 1 was original and very timely. Season 2, on the other hand, is shallow and boring. It could have been told in 2 episodes or be a (flat) TV movie, instead of the many, many, many drawn out scenes where the characters just sit or stand around exchanging meaningless platitudes. On top of that, each scene has to cut to overlong transitions of Sicily landscapes, the sea, paintings and sculptures, all to foreboding music. The characters are not interesting, their conflicts revolve around sexual desires and preferences and the dialog is dull and predictable. What happened, Mr. White? Season one Yay, season two Nay.",9,positive,positive
"I truly enjoyed the first episode and the series will be a huge success with a brilliant cast and realistic screenplay,  For me, it is not a fiction its very reasonable line of event which might possibly occur in the same way as the author portrays.  Pedro Pascal is a great choice for mixed characters and he is natural with very honest facial impressions.  Bella Ramsey at first sight depicts a wicked and crafty girl, just the necessary face and the game is truly stunning.  What I liked about the series also, the fact that they don't linger too much around horrible monsters, yet they detail what horrors might human kind do to survive.  In my opinion, the human race is very dangerous compared to other species should we be cornered, it would be very unpredictable how we would react.",10,positive,positive
"Loved watching a Western again! Totally miss the ""Longmier"" series staring Robert Taylor - hated that it came to an end.  First episode of this new series was awesome and I was glued to the set. I did find it strange that they used the ""F-bomb"" several times and that the sex was so explicit - but the story line and acting was awesome. Can't wait for Wednesday and episode #2!! Change of Pace TV Viewing - Thanks Kevin!! You are Amazing!!",9,positive,positive

"Praise Be this show is great. I knew I'd love it when I saw the commercials for it. So I decided I would read the book by Margeant Atwood which is now a hit show on Hulu. So that's what I did. You should really read the book before watching the show it will clear up a lot of stuff that's not explained in the show.  The Handmaid's Tale is a bit hard to understand for some folks so let me break it down for you. The Handmail's Tale is based on the book by Margaret Atwood about a futuristic time where men are sterile and women are barren and the wealthy men select women to be their handmaid to bare the wife's children to repopulate the world.  The book and show tells a story about OfFred played by Elizabeth Moss who was married and had a child and was living the perfect life until one day her world completely changed due to the government taking over the world and basically sending women to slave labor to be handmaids to rich masters wife to give birth to their children because they can't have any children.  Anyway you might be wondering the handmaid have the weird names like OfFred, OfGlen or OfSteven well the women who are taken into the homes of the Masters take on their first name to give up their selves so when they go out to shop or prayer meetings you know who you belong to. I loved Elizabeth as OfFred oh my God I hope she wins an Emmy this year for her performance because she pour her heart and soul into this role. When she tells off this Mexican woman who comes for a visit I wanted to reach into my TV and give her a hug. You'll have to see it to know what I mean but trust me if they play that one scene at the Emmy's she'll win hands down.  Basically the show is dealing with the lives of these women and how they are dealing with having their rights taken away from them and live a pure and faithful life towards their Masters. The Aunts I wanted to smack them because they treat the women like crap. They beat them, smack them around, torture them if they get out of line and really cruel for no reason at all.  Should you watch this show? Oh my God yes but keep in mind it is a MA-TV show so it's for an mature audience and I would read the book before viewing to have a better understanding of what your in for. Do what I did. Read the book, get Hulu for a month and then get rid of it. Easy, simple and only $8.",9,positive,positive
"I really love the games and was concerned with all the changes in the cast. However after the initial reviews praised it to be THE BEST THING EVER I had huge hopes. And as always, it was misleading.  The pilot was good but a little bland, the characters were just ok. Pedro didn't seem too much in character, even a little distant with what happened in the beginning.  Ellie is the biggest problem for me, as she comes off too annoying and has none of the innocence and quirkiness from the games, she's just in a bad mood all the time. A little forced.  As for the story in itself, things were way too rushed which gets in the way of caring for the main cast. Let's just wait to see more. Overall 7/10, above average but nothing special.",6,neutral,positive
"Pedro Pascal gives an outstanding performance in this series, drawing viewers into a story so engaging it feels like you're part of the world. His portrayal is full of depth and emotion, setting a high bar for the show.  Bella Ramsey also shines in certain moments, showing her talent, but her performance can feel inconsistent at times, with some scenes not landing as strongly. While this does take away a little from the experience, it doesn't diminish the overall quality of the show.  This minor flaw aside, the series is a fantastic piece of storytelling that leaves fans excited and ready for the next season.",10,positive,positive
"This might seem like a hot take, but I have been an admittedly obsessive Star Wars fan for god knows how long, and Andor is, in my opinion, without a doubt the single greatest project Star Wars has ever produced, and the more I delve into it and learn about it, the more layers of meaning and nuance I uncover hidden within its writing, acting, cinematography, sets, and even costumes.  I mean, it's by no means perfect, there are minor flaws as with anything, including the pacing of the first season and apparent irrelevance of an early established plot line, but on the whole, and in the details, it's pretty much as close to perfect I think a TV show can be.  Needless to say, I love this show, and it deserves all the love it's getting from the fandom.",10,positive,positive
"The Handmaid's Tale (2017-2025) is a tv series I was very late to the party with, but I did binge it last year in preparation for the final season and it was awesome. Now that the show has just ended, I can still say that this show was awesome.  Positives for The Handmaid's Tale (2017-2025): The premise of this show is very dark, chilling and gripping about this class-based society where things are pretty messed up for some of the people especially the women and while it was hard to grasp at first, I did get used to this show's tone and approach. I like how everyone has to follows these rules and go by what is required of them or else things will end badly for them and it makes you afraid for our characters as they try to break free from this society. The cast does an excellent job with their acting in the show including Elisabeth Moss, Joseph Fiennes, Yvonne Strahovski, Alexis Bledel, Madeline Brewer, Ann Dowd, O-T Fagbenle, Max Minghella, Samira Wiley, Amanda Brugel, Bradley Whitford, Sam Jaeger and Ever Carradine. The show is very slow-paced with its storytelling and it engulfs you into this environment that makes you feel dirty and uncomfortable but in the best way possible. The writing in this show is fantastic and it hits all of the right notes when it needs to during certain scenes. The show does have some missteps with a number of episodes, but not enough to derail the momentum of the show. Season 1-3 are perfect seasons of television, while Season 4-6 are great with some small mistakes in there. However, I did find all 6 seasons to be very engaging with the characters and the storylines. And finally, I really enjoyed the finale and it felt like the right note to end the show on.  Overall, The Handmaid's Tale (2017-2025) was a fantastic show on Hulu and I would recommend this show to everyone, so that they can experience it once.",6,neutral,positive
Stumbled across this looking for something to watch on Netflix and I was hooked. Such an amazing cast and even better acting!,10,positive,positive
"Completely divergent from the first two series. They had constant twists and turns that kept us guessing. In season 3 you could almost predict everything that was going to happen from episode two. Too many clues given away from the outset. The characters were all a little weak and unstructured. The story lines around the actress and her two friends was just weird. Some of the plot lines were left unresolved, the Russians for example. The actors mostly didn't seem to engage with their characters, except mum and dad. Very disappointed. If a fourth series comes along I certainly won't be watching it.",3,negative,positive
"As a born and bred Brummy with a mild interest in our history, I'm really pleased with this series. Firstly that we're not being overlooked for London, Manchester or Liverpool, and we're being allowed our own history, which is interesting and colourful.  At first glance the downstairs of the Shelby house looks too big to be the ground floor of a terrace, and people seem to be using their front doors far too often which, since there seems to be a significant amount of 'respect' being shown and rules being followed, it irks me that this protocol's being ignored. That said, it does look better to have the character using the front door.  My other issue is accents. In fairness, for the most part people are doing an amazing job - most real Brummy accents do not sound like the caricature most people think of, and this is being respected by the actors with only the occasional slip... except for Aunt Polly. Helen McCrory is a fine actress - a mistress of the Brummy accent she isn't. Her performance is making up for it however.  The Jamaiacan preacher amused me; as pointed out by another reviewer this actor is Benjamin Zephaniah: B'ham local and poet. Jamaica did send help over for WWI, so it's not impossible that several men stayed. He is a wonderful reminder that Birmingham has always been a hub for migration - even more so after WWII.  Sam Neill's performance is amazing.  So far the series is not just telling an interesting story, it's telling elements of Brummagem's history and present in a subtle and interesting way. I hope it continues.",8,positive,positive
"Many have already written about the series as a whole. I will write only about Ellie.  Bella Ramsey does a great job of portraying the character. (I was a skeptic about this earlier). But one thing. Ellie's character in the game is quite a quiet, self-contained person. (I saw it that way). After meeting Joel, she shows emotions, sharpness, fun, jokes. In the second part, she is generally completely alone and withdrawn into herself. Introvert. In the film, Ellie is initially shown as self-sufficient, blunt, and a bit of an anarchist. And this is very correct! The film has a more emotionally correct character. Considering in what world these children were born. But I like Ellie from the game more)",10,positive,positive
"Love Margaret Atwood and loved the original book. This is 1st time I've seen a series from a novel done so well other than maybe The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, and GOT. But those 3 were based on a series of books and this is based on just 1 novel. So Bravo to the writers who turned it into a full series.  I was terrified when I read the book, decades ago. But watching this while Trump was in charge TERRIFIED ME BEYOND BELIEF. If this pandemic would have sterilized people while he was in charge, We would be living in Giliad today. And you can hate on my comment all you want, But YOU KNOW IT's TRUE.  One of the Best running series on TV in last 5 years. The Pure Evil of the men in charge and a lot of the wives, and Aunt Lydia, is reminiscent of a lot of what we are seeing getting worse since 2016, with all the hate and violence. VERY SCARY.",10,positive,positive
"For the most part they are staying on point with the game. There are some differences but definitely welcome ones. Obviously a TV show has more time to explore parts of the story that might cause gameplay to drag. I'm in total support of the deeper dives into what gamers already knew of the story without taking away from the canon.  So far it's brilliantly executed!!! Actors have captured these characters perfectly. The scenes and landscape are what I remember from the game. I'm excited to see more & see how close to canon they remain, but it's so well done (so far), I imagine any more additions to the originally story will fit well and just enhance the narrative.",9,positive,positive
"Rewritten, incoherent, chaotic.  This series has nothing to do with books or the story there.  Writers are so inconsistent that main characters are jumping from one place to another end of continent in matter od hours, people are finding themselves in the middle of nowhere as a coincidence- this is just lazy writing.  Yennefer, the substitute mother are willing to sacrifice Ciri for magic - the common things with written character in books are only name.  Had good book, good story, nah, they rewrote it, change it, and clearly had little to noone orientation about actual world that was created in books.  Henry Cavill left series, and was a big fan. That says everything about this catastrophy.",6,neutral,positive
"I tried watching this once and never could get past the second episode. For whatever reason I decided to randomly try and watch it again and omg I am so happy I did. If Elizabeth Moss isn't the best actress in this century and the last, I'd kiss someone's booty. People will remember her for a long time.  I love the dystopia/apocalypse type stories and although this may be more mature than what I'm used to. 100% recommend.",10,positive,positive

Like most others i'm sure they weren't expecting too much from a netflix adaptation. But i was pleasantly surprised it was in in my opinion an easy watch. In my case it kept me coming back for more. I think Jenna did an amazing job of portraying Wednesday. My only qualm is they could've made her more like the original. In the way she was always trying to kill her brother she had no problem doing something bad. She wasn't just dark she was also a little evil. They could've done that with the whole family to be honest. They all seemed a little soft. But i still give a 10/10 because i still thoroughly enjoyed there adaptation. And i'm hoping for a second season where they can redeem themselves in that area.,1,negative,positive
"I must say that i lost a lot of interest in Star Wars universe after Disney takeover of this cult franchise, especially i was dissapointed by featured movies, than they started producing live tv shows, the first was Mandalorian which i didnt watched, then came Bobba Fett and Obi wan Kenobi which were okay but really nothing special, and then came Andor, and what a suprise, maybe someone will say it is very slow paced, boring or nothing is happening, i was one of that when i watched first two episodes of this tv show, they were really nothing special and were totally uninteresting but i gave a chance to the series and it was a good choice, Andor is mature, intelligent, very dark even dystopian feelings (especially i think on the episodes set on Narkina V) and still it is series which the most resemble old star wars and it feels like star wars, i also must say that i enjoyed the filming locations and the cast. Most of the cast is from UK which is very simillar to original triology whch was also filmed in United Kingdom. The cast is brilliant, my favorites were Denise Gough as imperial intelligent officer Dedra Meero, she is just for that role, amazing choice, cold, intelligent, ambitious and sexy also Genevieve O'Reilly as Mon Mothma is really good in her role. Stellan Skarsgard is standardly good, i must say i dont like Diego Luna so much, he doesnt have charisma and is not belivable, also must mention Andy Serkis in episode role he was just brilliant. This was really good tv show and i hope they will continue with quality in the second season. My grade 7/10.",10,positive,positive
"I had really been hoping to enjoy this more. An Addams family related property, in the hands of Tim Burton, how could it not be amazing?  Well, unfortunately it was very underwhelming. Overall look is pretty good, actors are all pretty good, but the script was maybe...not what it could have been. Honestly not surprised I later found the writers also worked on Smallville, and the level of quasi teen/high school-ish drama is sort of understandable once I learned that. It doesn't make it great, it makes the character of Wednesday feel less like an Addams though and more like a teeny bopper detective.  I would recommend trying it if you haven't, I was really wanting to like it more for the as already mentioned Addams family connection and Tim Burton in director's chair. I couldn't make it past the first episode, but don't let that discourage you. Even though it wasn't for me, it looks like it definitely is finding traction, so I'd say worth trying at least.  Was really hoping to at least make it to that dance scene, that looked great on the YouTube clips.",4,negative,positive

"I think if you're a fan of the books, or even the video games you will love this series. Henry Cavill captures the gruff, dangerous, almost elegant violence of Geralt with ease. It's clear he's played the games as his voice is almost spot on.  The time and effort put into developing Yennefer and Ciri makes the show vastly more interesting, and not a one horse (sorry Roach) show. If Episode 2 doesn't pull at your heart strings, or wrench your stomach, perhaps you're not human.  While not a ""Game of Thrones level show"" (let's be honest GoT dropped rapidly towards the end) for fans of high fantasy, the original books, and the video games, this is a no brainer. The world is stunning, visually enticing. The costumes, the accents, the names, its a truly engrossing world, with exceptional acting ability across the board.  For casual fans? Maybe not, but maybe a second viewing will tick some of those boxes, and have you singing ""Toss a coin to your witcher"" for hours.",1,negative,positive
"I rarely make reviews but wow. I don't even know where to start...  This show is so phenomenally amazing and exceeded all my expectations. The acting is superb with Jenna staring (who I absolutely love for this role, but in general as well). The music sets an exceptionally great tone for the stunning visuals.  The plot is extremely well written with an excellent story and the characters are very interesting, making me fall in love with them within the first 15 minutes.  This show never misses the mark and is entertaining all the way through.  Without a doubt one of the best things Netflix has released in a while. Looking forward to another season.",10,positive,positive
"I Loved the Concept of this Series .It was a Great experience. The series Catches me in such a way that i was conscious to know the name of the writer and to know about more series with such Concepts. Simply exceptional. I love the colourful and black and white mixed up Beautifuly. The thing that i loved the most was W Adams Savage replies to everyone and her nature of not disturbed by anyone's words,and the fade way in which the writer changes her nature was some out of the box stuff for me .The series was very family friendly and Was Very meaningful at the same time. So its the pick of the year 2022 for me.",8,positive,positive
"Directed by Tim Burton... Music by Danny Elfan... The look of the frame, the acting and story all remind me of the two now classic 90s Adam's Family Feature Films... Wednesday was my favourite character in the films, especially the second one when she and Pugsley got sent to Summer Camp...  Christina Ricci in those films as Wednesday was floorless, and it was great to see her appear in this too. Ortega's turn as the main character was excellent she is quickly becoming a great actress. I think you need to give the series time to develop and remember that it's target audience is quite wide, I don't think it's meant to be too dark. Just like the 90s films it plays on the dark and morbid humour, but with the teen angst mixed in.  Definitely worth watching if you are intrigued, but remember that it's not an 18+ rated adult only tale... it's a modern tale on these ever classic characters, think along the lines of the Netflix Sabrina series... If you liked that, then this should be right up your alley.",10,positive,positive

"A new story very well told and presented by Tim Burton. I can't believe how well Miss Ortega manages to contain her emotions and make the right facial expression at the right time. With just slight eye and face movements, she can appear happy, angry or scared. The new look at the story is much more interesting than anything so far. Frankly, we were tired of the ""nonsense"" at the Addams house. Also interesting is the moment that not everything in the Addams family is ok and there is a conflict between a mother and a daughter who is a teenager. Despite their quirks, the Adams have valor and honor, willing to defend justice and the weak at all costs.",9,positive,positive
"Some people think that starwars is just about lightsabers and wars, and Andor made their mouth shut by showing how the rebellion is formed and political drama. Andor made clear that fighting alone in the battlefield is not only way to win the war, it's about keeping the truth alive and it needs patience, selflessness, unity. Finally, this series made Rogue One even more heartbreaking and sad.  Luthen rael is the unsung hero of the rebellion. We witnessed his side of story and how he build the rebellion.  In season 1 the speeches of Luthen rael and maarva, in season 2 the the speech of Mon mothma are the powerful and one of greatest in the starwars.",10,positive,positive
"Listen guys, I appreciate the contrast between the old setting and the modern styling, but come ooooon!  Season 5 just seems to have a complete lack of direction and content. It's like I'm constantly watching one movie trailer after another. All the characters seem to have lost their substance. Everyone is so overdramatic. They're all doing stupid things that make no sense and sometimes look so unbecoming of their character. Almost every scene is so dragged on to a point that they become boring. By the end of an episode I sometimes found if difficult to remember what it was about.  Again, I have nothing against using modern styling and music to contrast the series' grey, gritty, and dirty time period, but it's so overused in season 5 that it's difficult to stay emersed and follow the story. It all feels so diluted now, so cheesy. Too bad.",10,positive,positive
"Just give the keys to these guys, they know Star Wars and we feel great under their administration.  We do not need elaborate plots and twist, Star Wars is all about this kind of simple moral things and histories. Great show, can't wait for more episodes",10,positive,positive
Everything was amazing in this series .All the actors played their roles beautifully. Actually it reminds me about game of thrones. I was missing that series. But this series is also amazing. Love it????,3,negative,positive
So there's nothing to watch at the moment bc we're all waiting for succession to come back in so we're watching this until then. But it's honestly like watch a bunch of boring vacations with very few sprinkles of dry humor. Any rating over six is just excite to watch a new show.,3,negative,positive
"Honestly, one of the best things I've watched in a while. I don't write reviews at all in here but had to for Wednesday. Enid, Eugene, Bianca, Xavier and Tyler all made this show fab to watch, but it was Jenna Ortega who stole the show!! She nailed Wednesday Addams in every scene. Thing was the perfect sidekick to Wednesday's slightly morbid personality. It was so good to watch her character go from loner to almost not a loner. The plot kept me guessing, the characters were all fabulous... I even liked weirder than ever, Uncle Fester. Enid, Eugene, Bianca, Xavier and Tyler all made this show fab to watch, but Ortega stole the show!!",10,positive,positive
"The show is a very good adaptation of the books and game series. Yet if you haven't read the books or played the games you might feel lost, so I suggest you keep watching until the season finale for things to make sense. As a fan of the The books and games I find that the show really hits all the right notes for me, and Henry Cavill did a perfect job bringing Geralt of Rivia to life.",10,positive,positive
"Apparently Star Wars of today works best when it's almost completely decoupled from the main story, characters and themes.  No one expected for spin off series based on a spin off of a boring Star Wars movie to be good. No one even wanted this. But I am shocked. Not that it's not bad, it's very good.  The ""worst"" thing I can say about Andor is also the best thing I can say about it. It would be as good even if it wasn't branded Star Wars. Because of the good writing, acting, characters, direction and interesting plot.  I thought Obi Wan series was, is an abysmal return to Star Wars franchise. So I'm completely surprised how refreshing and solid this was. Do I like my Star Wars being all adventury with mystical Force that is mystical just enough, like Fallen Order was? Yes. But when it's done good, this also works.  I love that ""villains"" are just some random pencil pushers that are brainwashed up by the imperial propaganda but are also very lost, evil people.  Very good show, if you can believe it. I didn't. It may not be Star Wars we wanted but it's Star Wars we needed. Which is the best kind of Star Wars. Recommended.",9,positive,positive
This is what star wars legacy should continue like. This is perfection. This is something else that can not be described easily. The bond between djin and grogu the story of the side characters everything is so perfect that i can not describe the way i feeling.,8,positive,positive
"With just a single episode out, it's hard to say whether Disney has succeeded, but one thing is clear: The Mandalorian is off to a great start, and it's perhaps the best proof yet that the Star Wars universe can lead to compelling content that isn't packaged for kids or reliant on Luke Skywalker showing up.  The first episode does a lot of heavy lifting to acclimate viewers to a part of the Star Wars universe that feels both familiar and new. There's the eponymous Mandalorian (Pedro Pascal), a bounty hunter not unlike the fan-favorite Boba Fett from the films. The Mandalorian is largely a blank slate; he's mostly silent, always masked, but very good at what he does: hunting down and sometimes killing bail-jumpers and smugglers for money.",10,positive,positive
"It has been a long time since Thomas Shelby becomes a brand. We have already seen filmgoers and fans imitate Shelby's dress pattern and much more. I'm talking about the British series Peaky Blinders which was telecasted through BBC. The sixth season of the series was come out in the past year. It gets brilliant reception like previous seasons. Let's move to the Gangster family in Birmingham on the verge of the last season which is about to come in the next year. The first season of the Peaky Blinders series was released in 2014. It didn't get much acceptance in the first couple of episodes but later after the 3rd and the 4th episodes the show or the season got the reception and became a success. The creator of the series Steven Knight talks about the real life of Peaky Blinders who were bookmakers, gamblers, and gangsters in 1880-1910 Birmingham city in England. Steven Knight was the maker of brilliant movies like Locke and Serenity and through Peaky Blinders, he just continued that successful making. Scarecrow in Dark Knight, Robert Fischer in Inception, Shivering soldier in Dunkirk, Robert Oppenheimer in the upcoming project Oppenheimer, and all the characters were done by Christopher Nolan's favorite actor Cillian Murphy, who did the part of Thomas Shelby in Peaky Blinders. This is one of the best performances from Cillian Murphy. Along with Murphy there were Paul Anderson, Sophie Rundle, Helen McCrory, Finn Cole, Natasha O'Keffee, etc were the members of the Peaky Blinders aka Shelby Family. Along with them, the Academy Award winner Adrien Brody, Academy Award nominee Tom Hardy, Sam Niell, Sam Claflin, etc were done a key role in the series. Apart from being a gangster film, Peaky Blinders can be attributed to a drama flick. The film not only travels along with Thomas Shelby but also with other characters. The first season introduces Shelby family to us. The second season shows the growth of Shelby's business enterprise outside Birmingham city. The third season portrays Thomas Shelby's intense bonding with Alfie Solomons (Tom Hardy), another businessman in Camden town. The fourth season reveals the revenge of Luca Changretta (Adrien Brody) on the Shelby family. The fifth season shows Thomas Shelby's shift as a politician and he becomes M. P. The sixth one portrays Thomas' murder of Micheal Gray (who was the son of Aunt Polly) and his existential crisis while doing so. Like this, each season has its own key elements but the visual representation and detailing of the elements gave a pivotal account throughout the series. The series' color pattern was a little bit dark in approach which flavors the total atmosphere of Birmingham city in the 1900s. The theme music, Red Right Hand by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds was an exquisite one that gave an adrenaline rush. The series is not a thrilling one like Breaking Bad, Money Heist, and Squid Game, not a fantasy flick like Game of Thrones or Harry Potter series, and not an ambiguous one like Dark or Westworld. It is something a different kind of dramatic version which is wrapped in a gangster story. You cannot easily enter into the Shelby family and it will take much time for that. When you enter, it is very difficult to get out of there.",9,positive,positive

"Peaky blinders is extremely interesting and captivating from the first to the last episode of every season. It's a very unique and different TV show that really stands out from other shows today. All the characters are all so well written, but the main characters are what really brings the show together. The show is packed with action and family drama. All in all the show leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat every episode, and it's needless to say one of the greatest TV shows ever made in my opinion.",10,positive,positive
"Just back to back binged White Lotus and Severance. Both are good but Severance is far better. White Lotus is described as a dark comedy. Severance is darker, funnier, far better acted, far better written. The comedy in White Lotus is basically non-existent. Only two characters are funny at all. I'll let viewers decide which two. The acting is mediocre at best. I cannot believe some of them were actually nominated for awards. Good PR reps I guess. The two college girls are awful. Totally stiff. The newlyweds are worse. Please take some classes. Show is entertaining but if you have only time for one. Severance is the way to go.",10,positive,positive
"The story itself is no doubt, extremely difficult, unbelievably complicated and extremely sad. However, the main actress is very insufferable... She doesn't really hit the emotional spectrum needed for this role. I see more stupidity and immaturity in her was of acting. She doesn't deliver the strong message that was intended.  At certain moments her facial expressions are unbearable. And as mentioned by a lot of people, there are just too many close ups that make no sense for the plot. It's not about boredom, cause the story is not. Neither are the other actors or actresses. The casting is immaculate, except for the main actress.",10,positive,positive
"I realy liked the mood of the first season. The story was little slow, but it never bothered me. It was like a cool sci-fi/western thing. (It reminded my boyfriend of the Firefly series.) The sets were great, excellent shootings at so many familiar places like Death Valley. If you like cuteness, there are some thing in it which will bring you round. And the music... I fell in love with it too much. :)",9,positive,positive
"I just finished the first season of The White Lotus and I was left with a seriously strange after taste.  I thought I was in for a show that truly put the nitty gritty of socialism and imperialism in the forefront. While these themes were there and surely, I can see the satirical aspect of it and the commentary that it was trying to do. I just could not for the life of me stand how the dialogue was written.  It was infuriating and it felt like the characters could just not say or express truly what they want and that to me, boiled my blood! JUST SPEAK ALREADY! Just say what you want to say and make it make sense!! Yes, sure, all the actors acted really well and they are a strong cast, blah blah blah. But omg, I could not handle the way they spoke to each other.  My qualms with the show is not even the cringe factor, I totally get that the cringe is there and it is intended. Is their communication style so bloody awful because its a way to display their already very toxic selves? In the case that it is not intended, then omg is it unbelievably pretentious! Look at us trying to say stuff without actually saying anything at ALL! Look at us trying to say stuff that has already been said and done in a way that is IONS better than this. Watching the characters speak was like pulling teeth! Just because a show is packed beautifully, has good actors and says ""something"" about society, does NOT deserve all this hype!!",1,negative,positive

"... I am a 48 year old female, living in Central Europe. This is what I want to start... because I always wonder what the background of those who rate something is.  As for this series: What catches me is how real it is, how easily this can happen and has happened. And is actually happening right now in some parts of the world.  Combine the Third Reich, North Korea and IS - that's what you get.  I have yet to read the book, but the TV adaption is haunting and not for the faint hearted, and I am assuming it transports what the book was about.  I was not sure if I should give it a 9 or a 10. A 9 for unnecessary lengths (I fast forwarded some scenes), a 10 for the actors and the message it tells.  I went for 10 as this should be a warning for all of us and a reminder how things were, are and could become. Just depending on where you live.",10,positive,positive
"These Star Wars shows are starting to take themselves waaaaaay too seriously.. like Andor..and its just becoming laughable and not worth anybodys time.. a solid idea for you Disney ..something to consider... YOU CANNOT SUBSTITUTE DRAMA FOR STORY CONTENT.. it just comes out that you are trying too hard and silly..this show is way too intense and slow moving for anyone to keep any interest or care about anything in it. Its borderline silly.  Star Wars was fun.. the original was a space opera that didnt take itself too seriously but was slightly grounded in reality as to make it somewhat believable ..that is what your shows are missing.  Andor...Kenobi... fett.... Mando They are all hollow.. vacant reproductions of Star Wars.. this one is no different. Just like the rest it lacks heart..like Mando had in the first season.. Id take this one back to the drawing board Disney ... someone elses drawing board though.. someone who actually cares for these stories.. and can find a way to tell them without insulting the audiences intelligence.. and tell them in a fun, compelling way that doesnt take itself too seriously.. that will get more viewers , and make people feel like Star Wars is back!  Right now, the future looks pretty dim for Star Wars because the money making cash cow has hold of it..  Disneys new slogan should be  If you can dream it... We can obliterate it.. Destroying it Over and over until there's Nothing left but your dashed ambitions for your favorite movies.. Thanks Disney.",7,neutral,positive
"There was absolutely no character that interest me at all. Went to get up a snack and when I came back I almost changed the channel, but I wanted to give at least the first three episodes a chance.  Diego Luna as the acting chops of a rock. The Star Wars' universe has such interesting, fun and funky characters from the animals, the androids, the humans to the animated (the free makers family is my favorite). Pedro Pascal under the Mandalorian mask with his little green baby have more personality in one scene than any of the characters in the first three episodes. This the show reminds me of the latest Batman with the super boring actor, Robertson. Is this the future of movies: bleak, grungy, dirty, non-shaved young actors who don't seem to care about anything and don't seem to do anything in their roles?",6,neutral,positive
"Or maybe if you have a party and need to distract a few folks.  The backbone of the storyline is the strongest point. The acting is good. The understatement is nice except when the action ruins it.  It is watchable, but tiresome. The story could be cut to about 2/3's the length. One has the feeling that the story is there to support the action scenes rather than the other way around. The action is fine if you like that sort of thing, but just too extended.  The dialogue is terse. That is the best feature. There should be more of it.  With a good editing job to pare this down to say 3 hours, this could be a great show. I hope someone does that.  Otherwise it is just more pablum for teenage boys.",7,neutral,positive

"I've been so excited to see this series & it didn't disapoint me at all!  Jenna Ortega was born to play Wednesday Addams & I really enjoyed watching her play this iconic character, that is loved by so many.  This series is so funny, entertaining, well casted & totally awesome from the very beginning until the end. It's a nice addition to the Addam Family's legacy ??  It was truly a delight to watch the amazing Gwendoline Christie play Larissa Weems. Her scenes with Wednesday were my absolute favorite. I love them & they both got my whole heart after their magical performances.  When I heard that Christina Ricci had been added to the cast, I was so happy & her performance as Marilyn Thornhill were pure brilliance.  Other favorites of mine from this series are Enid, Thing, Eugene, Bianca, Xavier, Tyler, Yoko & Ajax. I really hope we'll get a season 2, so we can see more of these wonderful characters.  This might not be to everyone's liking but I really enjoyed watching it & totally recommend you to give it a try!",10,positive,positive
"This series is relatively interesting but it makes me tired and depressed. There is a HUGE amount of animal cruelty depicted so that's really negative. Wolf gets run over by truck, they show the gore on his he road. House explodes and they show a dog with his rear half blown away pulling himself along and crying. A LOT of violence. There is nothing to endear you to any of the characters. Trouble after trouble. Mean spirited characters all around. If it weren't for bad luck, they'd have no luck at all.",9,positive,positive
"Every facet of this show is simply spectacular. The acting is superb from every single character, the cinematography is gorgeous, the overall plot is engrossing along with many supplemental sub-plots that just add to the intrigue of the show. This series moves along at a perfect pace with strong character development strongly tied to a complex family dynamic, with palpable tension that you can sense when something is amiss. This inevidently leads to some sort of conflict in evermore tantalizing ways between the core characters of the show. This series doesn't show good/bad, rather differing points of view in a way where you can almost assuredly understand both sides and why they make the decisions that they make in regards to their family/beliefs. Either way this is a phenomenal show and easily the greatest modern western piece of cinema to date.",10,positive,positive
"I don't write a lot of reviews, but my husband I watch A LOT of shows.. But THIS show, is like nothing we've seen before. The people who think this is slow, boring, etc. I simply can't wrap my head around. It's not meant to be an action series...come on! The acting, the directing, the filming, everything is brilliant. There aren't a lot of shows that have the ability to bring out just about every emotion you have in the span of 60 minutes. For me, this is a Top 5! The only thing that irritates me about it, is that we have to wait to watch!",10,positive,positive
"Amazing. I was astounded how great of an actress she was throughout the whole series. It was shocking, questioning and kept me captivated the entire time. Delicious. It was weird at times talking about necrophilia...but other than that, top tier. Not sure I'm selling this, just watch an episode and you will understand. I watched the original series of the Addddddams Family about a year ago and it drove my wife nuts, but after knowing the back story it made this so much better. But then again ""Wednesday"" the actress crushed it. Just teasing whether or not there will be more episodes, please!!!!!That would be so rude, cruel, despicable and so 'Wednesday' to not have any follow up.",1,negative,positive
"This is a weird show that sort of retells Harry Potter except it's a school for kids who are monsters, and somehow Wednesday goes there - but Wednesday has telepathic powers or something? I don't quite get it. The production value of the show is tremendous. It looks beautiful. Tim Burton directs some of the early episodes and does a good job. The Adams Family are ok cast - except I don't really care for Jenna as Wednesday. I guess Wednesday to me will always be a little girl but in this show she is a teenager going through teen issues. At least Jenna and the rest of the cast and crew care about the character and the role and the legacy of the franchise, so I give her a lot of respect for that. Weird show with good production values and kind of a Harry Potter riff - which is weird.",9,positive,positive
"It seems that HBO and Naughty Dog were serious on creating the best tv adaptation for a video game, and they exceeded expectations.  There is hardly any words that can properly display the amount of emotions the first episode puts you through, and is an amazing pilot episode.  Whether you've played the game or not, this show delivers changes whilst keeping the overall story similar.  The actors are otherworldly, Pedro Pascal as Joel is an amazing casting choice and he performs horrifyingly well.  Bella Ramsey, despite negative feedback on her visual comparison to Ellie in the games, delivers a true-to-life performance and captures the spirit of a teenager who hasn't truly been subjected to the horrors of the real world yet. It creates this gut-wrenching feeling that makes you- along with Joel- want to protect Ellie from the horrors of the Cordyceps virus.",10,positive,positive
Was not overly keen on Tom Cruise version but he is a good actor and enjoyed the movies But this series is pretty cool and Reacher is one hard dude and you can believe it  It won't set you world on fire but you will enjoy it Found myself nailing it in a few days Enjoy.,10,positive,positive
"I think this could've been a stronger show than it actually is. There are some good moments, but it's just overshadowed by poor story and how repetitive it gets. It's also quite difficult to get invested in the characters, and some of the side characters are really annoying.",10,positive,positive
"To get Star Wars right should not be difficult, yet Disney movies really struggle with it. But the people behind The Mandalorian clearly understand what makes it magical. Well done!",9,positive,positive
"This show is basically the Star Wars equivalent to Prison Break, where the first two seasons are amazing because they had a complete thought out story. While everything afterwards just feels like a fanfic just to bring the characters back together. The biggest mistake Disney made was undoing the whole point of the first two seasons of the show with the events of Book of Boba Fett which should have been a stand a lone series but felt more like another season of the Mandalorian. With that said those first two seasons in the ark that happens at the end, literally brought me to tears, and is one of the best moments in Star Wars history. Nothing can really take away that experience that I had at the end of that arc. However, the events of all the spinoff shows and seasons afterwards do kind of cheapen it for people looking to rewatch the series or getting into it for the first time.",9,positive,positive
"So I'm barely wrapping up season 2 and maybe my rating will change after viewing season three, but can someone tell me why nearly all of the female characters are insufferable?! I understand Jennifer Coolidge's character is meant to be obnoxious but sometimes it was just too much. Season 1 Alexandra Daddario's character was so agitating. Was she supposed to be a parody of a privileged out of touch white woman who was desperate to be marginalized? Season 1 wasn't AS bad, the men were more obnoxious but it all made sense for what they were trying to convey. Season 2 is where every female character was awful and written/directed to be airheads with little to no communication skills and it was taking me out of the story. So much stuttering, blank bug eyed stares, ignorant decisions made and overall adolescent behaviors for women who are in their late 30s and up. Oddly enough the prostitutes and Meghann Fahy's character were the only women written as well rounded adults who chose their paths. I'm just not someone who enjoys watching grown women be infantilized. Porsha's character was extremely obnoxious as well but I suppose she received her karma in the end. It just left me puzzled with what the takeaway was supposed to be from season 2. Was it that money doesn't buy integrity or brains? Was it that rich people are weirdos? Was it that rich people are just as degenerate as everyday folks? Or was it just a microscope on the lives of some rich people at a bougie hotel? Regardless of what the end goal was with the story, it left a lot to be desired in terms of closure and clarity. So far I prefer season 1 bc the storylines had clearer points of view while season 2 was muddy due to the strange way a lot of the characters were written. I found myself too annoyed by majority of the characters to get engrossed in whatever stories were being told. I'll see how I truly feel about the series as a whole after I finish season 3. But I can't stress enough how irritating and insufferable it was to see a bunch of adults unable to string a sentence together or be straightforward to move the story along, it made everything so stale and dragged.",2,negative,positive
"I'm note sure which is my favorite between The Mandalorian and this yet. The Mandalorian feels more Star Warsy, but this seems much more like a good show that just so happens to be set in the Star Wars universe.  What I especially like about it is how alive and real the world feels. You get a much more detailed look at the dawn of the empire and the rebellion than previously and the show doesn't seem to need to skip over the world building and get to the next explosion.  It's slower and more mature than most other Star Wars properties, so it's not likely to interest the younger audience, but it's great for those of us who have been fans for several decades.",9,positive,positive
"Pretty much what's on the title. It's basically just another piece of content that is not extraordinary in any way (except for, maybe, Murphy and Hardy's performances). Faulty historical narrative, extending the show for the sake of extending it, adding intimate scenes that mostly serve no purpose other than being a filler (might be Cillian Murphy's thing this one, I'm not sure. Not against them too, but it's stupid to have them be there and not contribute to the story), making the lead character a genius that almost always fails but has a backup plan nobody else knew or could figure out (which, of course, is not made obvious to the audience until it ends, but you'll start to see the pattern eventually) ... I did not even watch the show completely, I used random episodes I came across while my brother watched it as a pastime, and needless to say that I did not lose any of the plot from the episodes I did not watch. It's a piece of popular culture, you'll see it referenced probably everywhere. Could that be a reason to watch 5-6 seasons of this? I'm not sure, but I am thankful that I did not watch it in its entirety because what I did with my time was likely better than spending it on this.",9,positive,positive
Love it!!!! I'm in love with Cillian Murphy he is amazing- I thought I was in love with Jason Mamoa. Not anymor. Feels like I'm watching Sopranos but during the time that my father was a child. Crazy. I hope they continue this because it's one of the best.,10,positive,positive
"This show is one of the best I've seen. Just finished season 5 and it's still good! Originally rated 10 stars when it first came out, now rated it 8 stars. This show still has me hooked. Somehow after all this time, the characters still draw me in. I can't imagine what it would be like to be June Osborne, but I find her entire story inspiring. Her tenaciousness, bravery, and determination are unparalleled through it all. The patriarchy, Serena Joy, her children, Luke, Nick, Moira, Janine, and more. June is a force to be reckoned with which she has proved time and time again. This dystopian society doesn't seem too far off, and I can't get enough of this show. I'm excited to see how the series ends. Truthfully I could write an entire essay about this show. An important series of our time.",9,positive,positive
"I hate movies/series's. I always find plot conveniences, and holes. I anticipate the direction and I am critical of acting. Forget watching movies twice, 90% of movies/series I don't make it through. I lose interest quickly. I see something I don't like and I just can't continue.  The precision in this movie is insane. The Easter eggs, the acting, the costume choices are all intelligent, precise, and magnificent.  I want to mention the Easter eggs, but its best for you to discover them yourself.  I can't praise this enough. This is a masterpiece created by a true genius of cinema. It's an intelligent, well thought out labor of love.  The only thing I feel like they missed is capturing the same fear a bloater gives you in the game. Perhaps that is yet to come. As of now only 5 episodes have been released. It would be a shame not to capture the terror of that creature that the game did so well. I realize it is in there but, it just wasn't as scary as it was in the game. Minor gripe.",10,positive,positive
"The show itself was fun for me. I expected it to be too ""high school drama with teenage vigilantes"" but it actually kept me guessing so I did like that! I also liked how they incorporated Christina Ricci, since she also played Wednesday at one time.  Jenna Ortega was BRILLIANT in her performance! I really don't think they could have chosen a better actress to portray Wednesday.  My only real issue would have been Gomez.. Now don't get me wrong, I really like Luis Guzman but he just didn't seem like the right Gomez, for me. I think of Gomez as tall, slim & handsome like the original character. When I see Luis Guzman, I think of Shameless, not Gomez Addams.. So I think they could have done a little better with casting in that area, but Luis is a good actor so it wasn't completely bombed.  I hope to see more Pugsley in future episodes. And I also hope that Wednesday doesn't turn too mushy in future seasons, that would just kill her entire character! It would be cool to see her rub off some of her dryness onto Enid or other characters, just to spice it up a bit, but not too much so she still stands out like a sore thumb.",10,positive,positive
"Series 5 - After a rather boring opening episode with a few predictably unnecessary scenes series 5 gets off to a half decent start! You soon get into it and each episode is solid. In comparison to previous seasons, however, it just doesn't compare. With one episode left I can't help but feel so much more could've happened in previous episodes. In general, it's another enjoyable season but lacking in story when compared to previous seasons.  Side note - The amount of 'epic walk' scenes blended together with some quite appalling music needs to stop.",10,positive,positive

"I wish I could have grown up in Montana, it's such a beautiful state and seems to be unspoiled by the rest of American culture.  Some scenes are just breathtaking in their panorama and even though I have equal vistas on my doorstep here in Vancouver, the feeling of unlimited space is very powerful.  That unlimited space?  Well the entire metropolis of Greater Vancouver is about 750,000 acres with 2½ Million people crammed in. A ranch of this importance in Montana would be about half this size (close to 300,000 acres) with only a couple of hundred residents ... so yeah I'm talking unlimited space.  They mean it when they call it ""Big Sky Country""  So how did one man (and others of his ilk) get to own so much land in less than 150 years?  Well of course, they stole it from the Indians and the Indians want it back.  I would be mad too, if I was an Indian living in poverty while the white man makes billions off of my great grandfather's happy hunting grounds.  Not only that, but other well heeled Americans want to escape the fetid swamps of the crime ridden cities and live an urban cowboy life of luxury in their own log cabin, with a swimming pool and a country club to round things out. The only way for developers to carve out a piece of the desirable wilderness and chop it up to lot sizes, is to bully their way through.  And that my friends is the backdrop/plot for this superbly acted series.  Costner is unassailable in his role as the Rancher John Dutton, a no- nonsense patriarch chiseled out of Montana Rock. His family is the usual mix of screw ups and heroes but each and every one of them comes across as realistic characters.  I don't know who chose it, but the music is just brilliant with a few tracks from Jason Isbell that will knock your socks off.  I warn you that you'll be hooked if you start on episode one, and you might not see light of day for a week or two because you can't step away.  The cowboy world still lives on in Montana and Wyoming, the town centers seem to thrive, unaffected by the woes of main street America. Tractors gotta be bought, cows gotta eat, fences gotta be built, animals gotta be slaughtered, it's all business and it's wonderfully portrayed in this series.  There's a lot of violence, there's a lot of murder, but somehow it all seems to be a natural part of life in Montana, just like it was natural in ""The Sopranos"".  Guns are a part of life in an area where Grizzlies, Wolves and Mountain lions roam so it's no surprise that they're used to eliminate human problems too.  Almost nothing in the way of ""wokeness"" but I don't know if they can avoid it to the series end. We'll see  Enjoy it because it's a very rare classic from the streaming trash factories.",9,positive,positive
"I watched the film version of The Handmaid's Tale several years ago so the storyline was pretty familiar and the film I might give six or seven stars. However, in this adaptation, I had expected a little more than mere filler to justify the extended length. I don't think there was a major plot point which was not in the film. Both film and television versions seemed very two-dimensional, it has to be said, the dystopian world in which it was set seemed to operate without any explanation of what those in this world who do not occupy one of the roles we see actually do. It was a bit like looking at the cardboard set of a cheap sci-fi movie with banks of unconvincing fake spinning tape reels and purposeless flashing lights. The dystopia may have only existed in the lives of the households of the commanders and the lives of the handmaids for all the viewer knew; everything else was hidden from view. In the film, perhaps this was acceptable but in ten hours we learned more about the characters' lives in our near present than we did about the world into which they were forced.  I don't really know why I watched it. Perhaps I hoped that the dimension missing from the film was going to be furnished but it wasn't.",9,positive,positive
"The White Lotus may, at first glance, appear like yet another tale about the wealthy and privileged, but while IT IS that, it's so much more. Following various guests at the titular luxury Hawaiian resort, the White Lotus explores themes of class, race, gender (all the buzzwords), but in a way that feels refreshing, is funny, and most of all, deeply human.  I love how there are no caricatures in this show. Even characters we'd assume to be detestable are given moments reflective of their humanity and act in ways that I think most of us could at least understand.  More than that, the script is smart enough not to pigeonhole people into archetypes or boxes. That goes for the narrative as well, which takes unexpected yet predictable-in-hindsight turns that keeps the whole thing feeling fresh.  The performances are wonderful throughout, with Jennifer Coolidge and Steve Zahn being the real standouts for me.  It's 6 episodes, it's very funny, thoughtful, beautifully shot, set on a gorgeous Hawaiian resort, and has the stunning Alexandra Daddario in one of her best roles yet. What's not to love?",9,positive,positive
"It was a great mixture of direct and indirect social commentary on inter generational tensions (political views, social views, etc) and the class/caste system (especially in regards to the wealthy and their ignorance over the power they hold over those lower on the caste system; hotel guests - hotel staff). All of the hotel guests have a certain level of privilege and power (some more than others) that is wielded over the hotel staff. Even if some of the guests appear to be throughly empathetic or aware of the problems of others or caring, in the end they are still ignorantly using their privilege to get others who have less or no privilege to do things they want for them.  It's very entertaining, never a dull moment, great score, wonderful ensemble, amazing acting.",1,negative,positive
"What a great storyline to add to the Star Wars universe! Keep following this model and you keep the Fanbase going! Feels like a western and the man with no name comes in the form of the Mandalorian. Great action, great mystery and solid special effects. I'm hoping season 2 is even better.",10,positive,positive
"My god, I'm just done with season 2 but it feels like a life time! Don't get me wrong, it's a good serie.. but it's like it's in super super slowmotion. And don't even get me started on the many super close ups of Junes face. It does not make her prettier... and I don't think it is necessary. They could have made 3 seasons off this serie and all would be told. If I find the time I will finish it.. but only because the story is so good and it's exciting. And luckily you can fast forward a couple of times without missing something important... Sometimes I don't understand the choices that June makes..",7,neutral,positive
"This mediocre effort should have been confined to one series alone. If you cut out all the 'slow motion' scenes of the characters walking with tough arms at their sides, you'd end up with ten minutes per episode. Murphy is a great actor so I must presume that the money was too good to turn down. The attempt to build a Birmingham UK Godfather saga just did not work. Finally, a line of dialogue near the end of series 5 - ""Jesus ******* Christ"" Seriously? Whenever a writer/producer/actor resorts to this ugly blasphemy, it usually means they have nothing creative to perform. Garbage.",10,positive,positive
"First of all I did not think this series was much interesting thou I did not watch at all, but later seeing some reviews and suggestions from my friends, I decided to watch it.  So it is basically Wednesday Addams(Jenna Ortega who plays that role) start her new schooling at Nevermore Academy, which is for children's with special abilities to study and live in a comfortable environment. Eventhough she is not a friendly type person and have her own ways of doing and solving certain things. After joining there she encounters some mystery about her parents who also studied there before and a killing spree happening there at that time. She gets a psychic visions of the incidents which is going to happen in the future and she tries to find the killer and solution for all this problems.  Above all, this series is packed with comedy, horror and thriller situations , so I loved it very much and I wanted to watch more in future. Its amazing and fun to watch.",10,positive,positive
"I'm a huge fan of the novels and was never convinced that anyone could live up to Reachers legend. I was wrong. The first few minutes of Episode 1, that stare down. That right there was Jack Reacher. I hope that we get a ton more series and I can't wait to see which book comes next.  Supporting cast were excellent, I have been smiling all day since finishing the series. More please Amazon.",9,positive,positive
"Shaun Sipos was funny and a great male companion for Reacher to blend with. The fight scenes were incredible and strategically executed in each scene. I can't say enough about this season except that I was more involved in this series than any others I have seen lately. I hope they bring these characters back somehow. Maybe have them travel overseas and fight some terrorist group that wants to take over the financial security of the world? Please bring them back and have those ladies wear another set of beautiful gowns. They looked hot. I've read a few of the Jack Reacher books. While I wouldn't consider myself a fan who follows the series religiously, I did enjoy the gritty action procedural drama that was ""Killing Floor"", the book this series was based on. Reacher's first foray into the small screens translated most of the plot highlights and the feel of the books quite well. And as many who are familiar with the books will tell you, Reacher, the eponymous character of the show, finally looks the way he should look.  I didn't really have any problem with the Tom Cruise incarnation, mind you. But I always did find it amusing that one of the main trait that is immediately noticeable about the character (his size, and intimidating bearing) never translated onto the screen.",7,neutral,positive
"The good: Henry Cavill pulls it off. Quality of the acting is decent. The initial sorceress arc is pretty interesting. The timeline of the storytelling is well thought out and intruiging, and despite big leaps of time, remains coherent. Fight scenes are brilliant. With a few exceptions the sets and locations are very good. Music is expertly composed and produced. Props and clothing seem authentic and breathe life into the series. CGI is generally good quality except for a very anticlimactic 'dragon fight'. I guess this would have been expensive but what we saw of dragons was pretty poor - there was technically a fight but it was a poor distraction from what we really wanted.   The bad: You can tell they did this on a budget (but presumably did well with what they had). The aforementioned lack of a proper dragon fight. 'Clever' camerawork disguises some shortcuts. Some scenes and moments happen 'in our heads' without them being shown in full on screen. The supporting cast are very good but a few characters are not fleshed out enough to really care about them. Like episode 6 where there was a very cliche and contrived death scene which seemed totally out of place. The Witcher universe is dark, and not full of cliches (GOT reference intended). Episode 7 is too flashback heavy which hampers the progression of the story. We don't need flashbacks in a series that is 8 episodes long, unless you're playing for time. The grand scale of the final invasion is not achieved. Two men attacking some thorns is not an invasion. Some of the intros and endings are a bit underwhelming. The season finale is a great episode but the ending, while expected and appropriate, is not impressively executed.   Don't get me wrong, despite these criticisms I sincerely look forward to the next season and hope Netflix sign more episodes for season 2. It has the makings of a masterpiece and is by far one of the better things I've watched on Netflix this year.",9,positive,positive
"I really enjoyed this series. Jenna Ortega was spot on as Wednesday, in my opinion. She was sharp and witty and delivered her lines without so much as a smirk and I loved it.  What I didn't quite understand was the relationship between Wednesday and Morticia. I am not a die-hard fan of the original Addams Family show or movies, but I did see several of them and don't remember the tension and strife between the two of them, but maybe I'm just not recalling properly.  Overall, I can't wait for season 2 to come out. I hope that this series ends up having a few seasons. I'm excited to see what is next at Nevermore!",9,positive,positive
Millions of dollars spent on terrible writers and horrible directors while all this time their answer was right in front of them making Star Wars cartoons for the Disney Channel.,9,positive,positive
"I cant handle the acting and lines from the actress of Beth. Its too corny or cringe to me. Not sure if its overacting or underacting, *sometimes* it rarely works, but mostly she just ruins every scene (for me). Others might like her acting but.. yeh, my opinion. Seen all 5 seasons now.  Everything else I dont mind, would probably give it a 7 or 8/10 for that.  I really do like the other actors, they got each their own charms, good chemistry with each other, love the landscapes (thats probably half the point of this show, heh), the bad times and when the good times hit them you cant do anything but smile with them.  You MIGHT like the two prequel/spinoffs if you liked this, first one got bad pretty fast cause of another blonde daughter of the main character. The other one... didnt expect to see Harrison Ford ride again!",10,positive,positive
"The first season was very good and promising. The magic begin to disappear in the second season, but in the third one it is completely gone.  Lots of names, lots of lame jokes, a lot of talking but no action and fun at all.  I am watching and i will just because of curiosity. Will it come to a good end or we are just going to have another ""Lost"" series incident. They start good, lost their momentum on the way, and end up with that very disappointing last season. I understand they just create these series to earn money, but they better know where to stop.  Nevertheless, I think they better put an end to Witcher series or wait a little longer to come up with more concrete scenario.",9,positive,positive
"A new season just dropped and finally checked out this phenomenal new series by Mike White. The first season was an absolute treat of uncomfortibility and can happily say the second season keeps up the high level of quality. Each season follows a new location of the luxurious White Lotus hotel and each follows a new set of guests. Jennifer Coolidge is perfection throughout, the acting from everyone is top notch, as is the writing, directing, and sets. I'm so pulled in by all these flawed people, I think the real strength of this series is certainly the characters, their depth and complexity is to be admired. If you like being uneasy, enjoy the uncertainty, and are down to judge every character harshly, this might be the show for you. Would highly recommend.",1,negative,positive
"Oh i am so utterly obsessed with this show! Wednesday is EVERYTHING! And don't even get me started on her character development because my god did that make me an emotional mess. Love how realistically painfully slow it happened too, it was so bittersweet to watch. The plot twist towards the end, which i was deep down fearing though, stung a tiny bit since i was really into that whole part of the show too and was rooting for wednesday but it's making me even more excited for a second season which is hopefully happening! Special mention to the very likeable characters of edin and eugene and of course thing!! <3.",7,neutral,positive
"Is this a joke? I mean really?!!!! I waited two years for this series after Netflix gave the green light for the Witcher and the acting is just atrocious.the story all over the place. AND YES I KNOW THEY'RE SET IN DIFFERENT TIMELINES, but doesn't take away the fact it's just a bad show. Henry Cavill is the only BEST part about the show and even then...... it's like I'm just watching man of Steele dressed as an elf wig blonde hair and magic SMFH. If you want to watch a decent c- acting movie, do yourself a favour and go and type in Witcher parody. You'll get much better acting with bonus SATISFACTION.",9,positive,positive
"I'd never heard of the game. My kids have all played it  I almost never rate anything a 10, it's reserved for not just things that are high quality, but also that I love to rewatch over and over.  And we all love the show. Clearly it has stayed true to the game, but offering more depth to be interesting to everyone.  I love the grit. It reminds me of great quality tv, which you don't get often anymore. I haven't felt loved by shows in such a long time outside Andor. I hate you don't care so much about the destination but the journey.  My heart hope family looks for are to Sunday's where we can watch the show together. So it's nice to have something in g to share and experience with my kids (18 to 20 yo). Even my kids ode likes it. And she usually cringes the second she hears it's based off of a video game.",1,negative,positive
"The main trio (Geralt, Yen, and especially Ciri) pleasantly surprised me, but the lacklustre writing and some terrible creative choices made this season fall flat, IMO.  The show does such a disservice to the nuanced characters and rich lore of the books, and the writers have written themselves into a corner that will be difficult to retcon out of in future seasons.  I was really looking forward to this series, but was ultimately - extremely - disappointed.",10,positive,positive
"This show is a great show that does not have a lot of action, but the dialogues are great and the drama is the best thing, but if you want to watch it, you must be 18+ of age, full of sex scenes, which is the reason why I deprecated it. The first season was 7.7, the second season 8.4, the third season 8.10 for the most sex scenes Fourth 0.10 Fifth 8.8.",10,positive,positive
"Growing up with Ricci as the prospective serial killer child, more recent attempts to reboot the franchise have fallen flat. Moretz was good in the animated films but it still missed Ricci's little nuances.  This doesn't feel like a reboot but a proper follow-up to Addams Family Values - a few years later with the adolescent spooky kooky Wednesday being bundled off to a 'Hogwarts for Xaviers' and trying NOT to mingle but still attracting friends (and enemies) while uncovering a mystery.  Only just starting last episode now (8 episodes making it easy to binge) and hope there will be more.  Ortega takes on Ricci's Wednesday and expands on it further, and with Ricci taking on a substantial supporting role as a teacher works much better than it could have.",10,positive,positive
"I'm really in awe of the matured performances of both Bella and Pedro.  With every episode, they've been getting better and better as Ellie and Joel and setting up brilliantly for season 2.  Each episode has been improved in ways the game just couldn't do it. Only TV/Movies can do things that games miss out on and I'm glad they preserved the look and feel of the environment from the game.  I don't think there has ever been a better video game to TV adaptation (is there?)  Pedro too has so far nailed his performance as Joel.  While the other supporting characters are great, they are short lived and don't last  I can't wait to watch the final two episodes.",10,positive,positive
"Peaky Blinders keeps you hooked throughout. The occasional dull moments are followed by plot twists that make you sit up and get interested again.

"This is the Star Wars we have been wanting for so long. Last two episodes felt to me like a separate movie. Series Mandalorian is filled with emotions, epic fight scenes, humour...

"I guess I'm in the minority here with not thinking this series is sensational. It's kind of a mix of X-Men and Harry Potter with a lot more dark and evil aspects thrown in and a lot less likable main character. Wednesday is selfish and rude and hateful, yet somehow everyone seems to like her, including the two most attractive high school guys in town. High school guys must be much different nowadays in what they're attracted to than when I was in high school! I like that there's character development in Wednesday but it literally doesn't happen until the last episode, so it's a long time of watching her mistreat literally every kind person around her before she learns any kind of lesson. I also was bored a lot, as it seemed the mystery was taking too long to unravel without much new information in each episode, so I guess in general I just didn't think this show was very compelling.",10,positive,positive
Watched the first hour of the first episode. So far I like what I see. I never played the first game. Played the second. I'd give that game an 8. So I missed the backstory behind Joel and Ellie. But I can say I agree with how the first hour played out in regards to a real world outbreak. The first scene with the runners looked good. The way they run and act along with them being clumsy etc... is true to the game. Haven't seen them yet but the previews showing the clickers looked good too. We shall see. I'm wondering if they are gonna have the other ones from the game this season. I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't. Save it for the next one. I think if they keep wokeism away from the show it will be good. So far a 9 I'd say.,7,neutral,positive
"Perhaps not Game of Thrones, but it's up there with Sopranos and all those series that know how to tell a story. Great character development, slowly exposing backgrounds. Excellent drama. The western genre is incidental, and, if anything, adds to the depth, by providing a refreshing ambiance in Montana, with the ""new cowboy."" Each episode is a well-told story. Superb.",9,positive,positive
"I completely agree with others that Alan Ritchson eclipses Cruise's depiction of Reacher in the movies. There's no disputing that now.  Count me in for a second season. The series caught my eye when I found out Ritchson was starring. I know Ritchson from Titans, and that was my incentive to check it out.  Great cast. So-so writing causing some dead spots, could use a little improvement. Hopefully next season there will be less useless filler content.  The hookup was predictable and I'm just going to say it - cheesy.  Malcolm Goodwin's character was fun. Perfect level of annoying at first, but as the story progresses, Oscar Finlay has a more profound impact on the overall vibe of the series. Goodwin absolutely shines in his role.  I'll watch just about anything with Bruce McGill in it. He's an amazing, versatile actor.  It was nice to see Harvey Guillén as part of the cast. For the first few seconds it was hard to separate him from Guillermo (What We Do in the Shadows), but he nailed his role here.  Lastly, and this is the only time I'm going to say this. In this particular series, pie > cake.  Happy viewing!",9,positive,positive
"I originally watched this when it released and revisited it just now and it's just so enjoyable. Yes the writing has it's flaws and Wednesday didn't need to be in a love triangle storyline, but Jenna Ortega's performance is so great that I couldn't bring myself to rate this less than a 10. She's the kind of actress that you're just immediately drawn to anytime she's on screen and I'll watch anything she's in. Easy to see why she's racked up so many awards and acclaim. I also love the look and vibe of the world that was built, as I thought it gave off that classic feel of a Tim Burton film. Danny Elfman doing the music fits perfectly and Collen Atwood and her costume design was immaculate. It's just a visual feast all around and so well done. I read Jenna will be a producer on season 2 which is exciting, as I think many of the writing flaws will be corrected. I also hope Tim will direct more than 4 episodes next season.",10,positive,positive
"Ok, let's be very real. It's very hard to create ""true"" realism through the lens of fantasy. But this first episode really captured the details of such a world. HBO are masters of details. What this adaptation need more, as it goes forward, is very good dialogue, actings tension,and story, to surpass the world they created. I hope they will as this it is an incredible start of a new show.  For the people that have not played the games, I can tell you that the story gets better and better with every episode and it could possibly turn out to be one of the greatest TV shows of all times if they focus of those details. It's all in the details.",9,positive,positive
They ruined the last season of the show. It used to a slick gangster drama and the last season was nothing like that. It was a sob story sprinkled with politics and supernatural elements.,10,positive,positive
"The story is amazing, all the actresses are so great especially Lisa. As a debut actress I think she did a great job. Anyway I'm looking forward to see what's coming next and more of Lisa's performance. I'm new for this series but already a big fan and I can't believe that I didn't watch the white lotus series before, such a waste. I'm just obsessed with all the story around rich people and I can't believe I like it. But I heard that there were some shock scenes happened in the pre season it make me worry a little bit but still excited. Overall It is worth watching and those who have not seen it should see immediately.",6,neutral,positive
"As an enthusiast gamer who has played Last of Us 1 and 2 and an avid watcher of TV shows, the show has been as per my expectations so far, however, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau could have been a better option for the portrayal of JOEL's character. Anyhow hoping for a thrilling series ahead... 9/10.  The Last of Us subverts narrative expectations for its specific genre by straying away from focusing on survival. Though the characters clearly want to stay alive, the series does not concern itself with heavily focusing on Joel and Ellie's conflicts with others - they're there, of course, but that's not what this series is about. These episodes are about the relationship that is formed between Joel and Ellie, two people separated by generation and bound by necessity, as they travel across the dangerous landscape that the United States has become. They must not only deal with the Infected, the cannibalistic fungus-covered monsters, but also the deadly people that have been forged by the new world. Everyone Joel and Ellie come into contact with have their own distinct motivations for their actions, leaving the audience to decide their own beliefs on the morality of these decisions. The Last of Us might not be as graphic as the video game it's adapted from, but that makes it no less intense. There are shocking moments of violence that should be expected from a world like this, such as graphic cannibalistic deaths from Infected or more emotional deaths of younger survivors. That isn't to say the series doesn't have its lighter moments, as there are brief moments of levity peppered throughout the season, especially moments involving the relationship between Joel and Ellie and the jokes they share.",7,neutral,positive
"So we're onto Season 5. Just watched the first episode and wondering if I will continue. It's just so depressing. Not that I want/need to watch happy-clappy TV, it's just that when the real world is already depressing do I really want to see it on my screen as well? Plus let's talk about June. She's becoming plain annoying tbh. It isn't helped when the director keeps giving us the Kubrik big close up every few minutes. That camera framing has become tedious. So while I admire the acting and production values and it's continual critique of society, I'm not sure if I will continue. However, I do feel invested so may tough it out.",10,positive,positive
"OK, so I gave this an 8 but that's all on the superior strength of season 1. I don't know if they got a different director or different writers or what but season 2 is so contrastingly bad it can be hard to watch. Season 1 had an amazing script that kept you hooked, had great pacing, and a wonderful cast that all fit their roles extremely well. Season 2 has none of that. The script seems to drag as if they're stalling for time, and the cast outside of Reacher and Neagley is Sharknado-level bad with Dixon being the worst. Total whiff on that one. All that said, Reacher is light years better than anything on network TV so even though season 2 is a letdown it's a better way to spend your TV watching time than the self flagellation that is sitting through yet another singing or game show. Check it out, just temper your expectations as you start into season 2.",10,positive,positive
AMAZING! I binge watched this in one sitting and I now don't know what to do with my time. So good.,6,neutral,positive
"One of the better watches lately, entertaining with the odd bit of humor every now and then, and some decent fight scenes too, although they can be a bit inconsistent, for example in the first episode Reacher can easily handle 4 big nasty looking prisoners all at once, but in a latter episode almost gets taken out by a skinny dude about half his size.",10,positive,positive
"I binged the first season in two days, I was not bored even for a moment. It seems like nothing is really happening, I mean there isn't a lot of action but the characters are developed really well and they seem to me like the rich people in real life, sometimes with problems that an average human can't really relate to.  The second season is even better than the first one in my opinion, I am anxiously waiting every monday for a new episode to see how it will all play out in the end. All the characters are so interesting, everyone is annoying at some point but thats what keeps me watching. I love Aubrey Plaza in this one, she is so gorgeous!",9,positive,positive
I love this show so much. I don't understand people who say this show it only geared towards hardcore Star Wars fans. This was the first Star Wars thing my aunt ever saw and she loved it as well. Madno had a great character arc and felt like he learned a lot from where he started in the first episode. Episode 3 and 8 are my favorites and I'd say the only one that is pretty bad is episode 5 but even that episode has good elements. So hyped for season 2!!!,8,positive,positive

"This 'Star Wars' spin off series is set shortly after the events shown in 'Return of the Jedi'; the Empire has fallen and the New Republic has been established. There are still independent planets, where most of the action will take place, and remnants of the Empire.  The story is centred on Din Djarin, a bounty hunter known as 'The Mandalorian' or 'Mando'. One day he is tasked retrieving an individual that turns out to be a baby of the same species as Yoda. He succeeds in this but then feels guilty and rescues the child and flees. He is now hunted by the bounty hunters' guild for breaking their code. Even worse surviving elements of the Empire want the child back. The unlikely pair will get involved in a variety of adventures; some lasting just an episode; some lasting a season and others continuing through the series.  I really enjoyed this series and I expect most 'Star Wars' fans will too. I liked how it is mostly centred on characters that didn't appear in the films, there are some enjoyable appearances from old favourites but for the most part these are fairly minor. Mando and The Child are great central characters and they are supported by an impressive range of secondary characters, some of these appear regularly others just for an episode or two. The series captures the feel of the films with impressive backdrops on a variety of planets. The cast is impressive, especially Pedro Pascal who does a great job as Mando, even though we rarely see his face as his creed demands he doesn't remove his helmet in the presence of others. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of 'Star Wars'; I'm looking forward to the next season!  If you have yet to watch this make sure you watch 'The Book of Boba Fett', or at least episodes 5-7, between the second and third season as it shows important details of The Mandalorian's story line.",6,neutral,positive
"This series is so thought provoking. Could we end up here?...Rhetorical... I love the cinematography. You feel like you are on those streets. The sounds of the walkies always somewhere, the rain, like tears, falling on the streets, the look everyone has of distrust and despair. It's so sad. There's a point of view around every corner, and you can almost understand each. Thank you for this series! Please don't make us wait in perpetuity for more.",10,positive,positive
"Actors are fabulous! Coolidge being the best! There are only 2 types. Those who hate and those who love it. It seems pretty obvious that those who hate it seem to all feel it's some white people attack. Others like me see characters that are funny as hell ,rich as hell and are terribly flawed. If you don't get annoyed there's something wrong. You are supposed to get annoyed. The music is addicting. It's overall a great show compared to other shows on right now. I gave it an 8.

"Bear with me for a second. I live in London and honestly I find it very off putting and unrealistic the everyone speaks with very strong and distinct British accent. It just feels like I'm watching my neighbours and locals acting in the movie. If you were from let's say Australia, wouldn't you mind if all actors spoke with Australian accent? In this movie , 90% or more spoken English is with British accent. A lot of new productions do this nowadays and I just can't bear it. It's both lazy and unrealistic. What happened with training to learn a new accent as other actors such as Anthony Hopkins or Christian Bale have done in the past?",9,positive,positive
Very well done it's nice to see a video game come to life just wish the season was longer it went by too quick,10,positive,positive
It's like living in saudi arabia i'm so sad because of my life in this place,10,positive,positive
"Let me say that i do not understand the negative ratings. IT WAS REFRESHING TO BINGE WATCH ALL OF THE EPISODES IN A DAY. This was quirky, funny, unpredictable, as well as satirical. It had you wanting more and anticipating the next episode. Im realy tired of short series being about cops, or mainly about drugs, or finding dead children. Refreshing to watch! Kudos to the writer and the actors were all amazing as well.",7,neutral,positive
"Alan Ritchson is a perfect Jack Reacher.a hunk of a man with a brooding almost anti social attitude who seeks Justice and makes he's own rules. The series did a great job in helping us know the man by youth flashbacks and snippets of character scenes like the one with the abused dog. He is a man you would definitely want in your corner. His charisma overtakes the screen but his rage is always there but he uses it to help the defeated.  Ritchson is an actor I did not know, but he is powerful and so macho handsome and the rest of the cast so a terrific job especially Willa Fitzgerald as Roscoe. I absolutely love this series.",9,positive,positive
"Each season gets better and better, but season 4 solidified its place as one of the best tv shows in history Adrian Brody gave a great performance playing Luca Changretta, and Cillian Murphy gave could not have been better giving us consistency throughout the seasons",10,positive,positive
"A very entertaining and captivating HBO series with 14 eps. It was the most successful miniseries of the last Emmy ceremony, with 10 wins in almost all categories!  It's a dark cynical satire about the pampered upper class, their privileges, transactional relationships, and their petty problems. It has an undercover vibe of the movie Parasites to it.  Besides the casting, acting, writing, and cinematography, the music score is amazing and controversial in a good way (see ""Why the score of The White Lotus makes me feel anxious"" on YouTube).  The humor is quite funny and the characters are very relatable well written and acted. Expect heavy laughter midway through. Watch the characters develop and the drama unfold when the House of Cards comes tumbling down.",10,positive,positive
"If you really feel this is so much like GOT, are you really even a fan? This story like is so much more different. This story goes into the magical world of mages, monsters and wizardry. This has a great plot and phenomenal acting. The casting is spot on. The writing is exceptional. Graphics/CGI are great. I had trouble following along the story line. There are many flashbacks and there is no warning, you just find yourself confused until you figure it out. I would give it a ten if I could follow easier. Also, many curses, potions and rules/laws are used without any explanation. This can be confusing as well. I had to Google a lot, thank you Reddit. I can't wait for the second season to come, i just hope its soon. It really is a must watch.",3,negative,positive
"To be honest, this series is one of the best of Netflix. Jenna Ortega is fascinating in her role as Wednesday. She plays it so good that you always want to see Wednesday in every scene. Except that, all the characters, the topic, the places, everything is spot on. It gives a bit of a Harry Potter vibe with the school etc but it's definitely one of the best TV series I've ever watched! You might think the series seems childish or disney-like but i can assure you that I've thought the same at first but it definitely was something else from both Netflix and Jenna Ortega. Plus, we all know Tim Burton who directed this series, and we know he's extraordinary. Definitely worth the watch!!!",6,neutral,positive
"I'd give this series a 10, but it had a few nonsensical plot issues. Minor wouldn't happen that way things, and what was obvious to me of who did what. Not going to do a spoiler. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed each action packed episode. The writing/dialogue were top notch, as well as the stellar sound effects and cinematography to complete a well crafted product. Many times I felt actual fear and trepidation during unfolding events. I will keep my eyes peeled for a season two and look forward to binge watching the next series as soon as they are available.",5,neutral,positive
Optic and feeling mostly nice.. Story and dialogue nothing big.. I've expected more..,9,positive,positive
I've enjoyed this show. I love Reachers dry humor (if it can even be called that). Ignore the negative Nancy reviews. Did the show get you as invested as Goliath or Bosch? I don't think so but it's also in a category of its own. I'm hoping for another season.,7,neutral,positive
"In a nutshell, the story is real.  It is rooted in historical fact. It includes nothing that has not already happened to women across the world.  The acting is brilliant, and beyond that, the cast seems determined and devoted to tell this very powerful story for not only women, but men. When people's rights are trod on, it affects everyone.  Let's hope that if it ever comes to something like this, more people will be strong, rather than weak. Unfortunately, based on just today's society and who holds the office of POTUS, that may not be the case.",10,positive,positive
"I literally created an account just to leave this review..I don't understand the hype for this teen drama cringe rubbish. I was excited to start this show and after a few episodes in I can't understand the hype for this generic show.  I really wanted to enjoy the show and maybe I set expectations high after seeing reviews online and all the hype around the show. But I found myself to be just cringing at every episode whilst finding none of the characters interesting.  It feels just the same as the new Sabrina the teenage which show, but tbh I found that to be better than this even.  I found Thing to be the most interesting character, and that's just a hand.",6,neutral,positive
"The show feels like a gothic sociopath Harry Potter is stuck in Stranger Things. The show is not very scary, but it has a dark atmosphere with a crime main plot. Every now and then there are funny or uplifting moments which makes the show surprisingly fun to watch. I would say the humour is aimed at a younger audience (<18yo) and generally the show seems to be aimed at this audience. I am sure that if I were around 15 years old right now I would love this show and give it a higher rating. The ending for too predictable for me and overall the acting is below average (with the exception of Jenna Ortega who does an excellent job). Overall 7/10 I watched the entire first season but I am not interesting in the second season which inevitably will come out eventually, considering the success of the first one.",9,positive,positive
"It's easy to tell who is a fan of the books and who hasn't read them by reading these reviews. This should never be compared to the The Bridge or Bosch. I have read all of Bosch and all of Reacher (that has been released) and I love them both, but for different reasons. Bosch is a gritty, true(r) to life crime drama with a veteran detective as the hero. It's a dark (but not too dark) look at true crime. Reacher is a fun, over the top action series with an oversized ex military cop who believes in true justice no matter what it takes. It isn't supposed to be gritty, or dark (even though it has its moments). If you like cinematic action movies and shows with some simple but fun twists, just sit back and enjoy the ride and you will not be disappointed.",1,negative,positive
"Wednesday is one of the MOST AMAZING shows that I've seen this year, and I don't say that so lightly. The writing has you questioning the motives of everyone in the story-nobody is safe. It draws you in as you experience being in the shoes of Wednesday Addams, and, surprisingly, you become almost as cynical and untrusting as she does as the series progresses.  Every single moment was thrilling, curious, and downright entertaining. The story thrives on mystery, suspense, and the supernatural; truly, a wild and exhilarating combination. The subtleties of her persona are so wonderful while every other character has a meaningful purpose. You will absolutely love this show!",8,positive,positive
"I really enjoyed this and it's so much more reflective of the original cartoon/comic by Charles Addams.  Gomez was originally depicted as having a somewhat grotesque appearance, with a tubby body, a snub-nose, a crooked tooth and a receding chin. Luiz Guzman portrays this so well.  Catherine Zeta Jones is so beautiful and elegant, I think she plays Morticia well, although Angelica Houston is a hard one to beat!  Jenna Ortega is brilliant as Wednesday and was pleased to see Christina Ricci in the show too as one of the teachers.  Loved all the other characters in the school.  Really hope this is renewed for further seasons.",10,positive,positive
"Updated Review: I am rewatching this series and I have no doubt in my mind I will watch it once more before season 3 comes out! I don't know what it is about this show! Actually, yes, I think I do-a perfect combination of writing, directing, casting, acting, set design, special effects, overall production and probably even costume and sound editing!  I went into this with no expectations. My son informed me in advance that there were no lightsabers and he has indeed found the majority of the episodes boring. There actually is much more to Star Wars than Jedi Masters and Sith Lords! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this series if you have always wanted to know more about how the rebellion formed and how they received support, equipment, weapons, and funding. You also learn about on-planet Imperial personnel and their high-stakes administrative dealings. The first reviews I read here on IMDb were shocking and immature! I might put the episodes in the slow-burn mystery thriller genre. There is a lot going on in many different parts of the galaxy and it does require patient attention to detail. When the puzzle pieces start to fit together it's extremely satisfying. It has a different feel and pace than Rogue One, it's meatier, more intricate.  TL;DR - Fantastic modern Star Wars drama with less sci-if Force references but more espionage and storytelling. Don't worry, there are still ""Pew, Pew"" moments and TIE fighters (and they've made them scarier and somehow fly faster than ever).",10,positive,positive
"What else can be said that hasn't been said, this show is absolutely phenomenal and will make you feel like a kid watching star wars for the first time. i wish we could all personally thank jon favreau, dan filoni and pedro pascal; these 3 have brought star wars back to life and are ushering in millions of new younger fans. lastly, grogu ! the superstar of the show and the kid who has stolen all our hearts, he's the most adorable thing in the galaxy. the bond between father and son is what makes the show so great. this is the way !",10,positive,positive
"But the most rewarding. This has been hard viewing. A lot of it strikes far too close to home. But everyone should watch it. No matter how hard. The acting is superb, the storylines are shocking. And it makes you realise quite how lucky you are. There are very few shows that I would tell anyone are essential viewing. This is it.",10,positive,positive
"The producers of this show must think their viewers are idiots. Season three is not moving forward.. Just one close up after another. Red fabrics and pale backgrounds. It was beautiful in season one. Now I'm just fed up. And if you are looking for some deeper meaning or any hidden story between the lines, I think you can stop looking. There is none.",10,positive,positive
"FINALLY!!! A video game adaptation worthy of seeing! It just goes to show what can happen when you follow the source material, bring on the same people responsible for the success of the game, pour your heart into it, and have the original creator take the helm. Halo (Paramount+) could learn some very valuable lessons from The Last of Us (HBO). Do not walk, RUN to see this show!  *Spoiler Free*  Right from the get-go 'The Last of Us' immerses you into the world you've come to know and love (or will come to know and love). The casting is pretty much perfect, every star has perfectly embodied the spirit of their characters to a ""T"". Nico Parker's portrayal of Sarah is pitch perfect. She acts her heart out in every scene, showing the same witty nature and heart from the video game. Pedro Pascal as Joel is a treat to behold and the expansion on his character, however small, brings a new layer of depth to the character that feels familiar but also new. Gabriel Luna makes for an excellent Tommy, everything from his body language to how he speaks, he is a near crystal copy of the Tommy from the game. Anna Torv makes for an amazing Tess. She's dry, grizzled, and comes across extraordinarily strong. Bella Ramsey perfectly captures Ellie's fiery spirit and strong willed nature, while also eluding to the darker side of her past. And Merle Dandridge makes for a top notch Marlene, from her commanding voice to her soft nature.  Every cast member has poured their heart and soul into their performances, making for a believable world that immerses you into their stories. Fans of the games will be hard pressed to find anything wrong with this show. Though not a 1:1 remake, HBO's The Last of Us expands upon the universe of the game, flushing out the characters and the world in a way that feels fresh and natural. Nothing is out of place, nothing feels wrong, it is the original game amped up to 11. HBO's The Last of Us respects not only the fans of the game, but newer audiences who are just now dipping in their toes for the first time.  And big props go to the creators and crew. Together they brought one of the greatest video games of the past decade to the real world. Every aspect of this show, from the cinematography, the editing, set design, music, special effects - it all perfectly encapsulates the tone and atmosphere from the game, and it all feels real. I'll be honest, I was very skeptical at first when the show was announced, and after the first trailer I approached it with cautious optimism seeing as I am such a huge fan of the game and the trailer looked to stay true to it. And let me tell you, it is worth it. I wonder how scary they'll make it, since sitting alone in a dark room *playing* it is significantly different that *watching* it - that pressure you feel while playing it with the whole ""I have to watch my back, check all the corners, listen to all of the sounds in an environment, etc.,"" is gone, but that allows for other changes to be done with someone watching things unfold instead. Super excited and can't wait for the next ep!  I watched with a friend, but right after I RAN to subscribe to HBO Max because they DESERVE the subscription!!!",10,positive,positive
"With the last couple of Star Wars series, I was complaining about Disney relying too much on nostalgia, and not enough on good writing. Andor was the perfect response. Starting with (mostly) unknown characters and planets, the writers created an immersive world with an intriguing story, deep characters and interesting cultures that I can't wait to explore more. A series that someone who has never watched Star Wars could enjoy. The only small complaint that I have is related to a couple of episodes where the pace was incredibly slow and not much happened. However, the setup in these episodes led to such good payoffs that in the end I don't mind much. I really hope that future Star Wars series will build on this standard that was set by Andor.",10,positive,positive
"I have a shot every time Junes face fills more than three quarters of the screen. I love every episode although by the end of each one I have difficulty remembering specific events that happened in it.  The 1,000 yard stare has been perfected as the seasons have progressed, although one too many can start to feel comical but that really depends on my mood at the time of viewing. Surely they should keep a chart of how many times per episode June gets a close up so it wouldn't impact on my health too much.  At the end of the last season, I was wondering how June keeps her eyebrows so neat. Surely Handmaids don't even get to use lotion for their hands and they have to have their Martha stand guard while they shave their legs once a month, so there's no way they have tweezers to keep their eyebrows tidy.",10,positive,positive
"I was really looking forward to this series, in fact it was the main reason for getting Disney but I've found it so predictable and frankly dull. The plots seem to be weak and everyone walks so slowly my 95 year old dad could lap them with his zimmer. As it's only 8 episodes I will watch the second series just to see if it improves but this has been the most disappointing series I've watched in ages.",10,positive,positive
Excellent acting....excellent characters....excellent setting...excellent storyline's doesn't drag on with loads of fillers like some series do can be violent but it's not over the top gore it's one of those shows that leaves you disappointed when you know you have watched the last episode of the series and need to wait a while for the next!,10,positive,positive
"Only half way through the season and I'm fist pumping that there are 6 more episodes and it already feels like I've watched a few full length movies.  Edgy, cool, suspenseful - characters that are relatable, dialogue that actually makes sense and a storyline and pacing that is both engaging yet familiar.  Rogue one was a triumph in the Star Wars universe - made for people that don't need to be spoon fed syrupy goodness like naive children but still have values and beliefs.... and *gasp* adult imaginations.  Thank the almighty someone was listening and Andor carries the torch.  Alas ...If only Kenobi had the same tone.  Nevertheless, Andor has restored my faith.",10,positive,positive
"The first three episodes are pretty good. We have a mysterious, intriguing main character. Exciting setups and solid Star Wars visuals, then Baby Yoda comes along. I love Baby Yoda but for some reason The Mandalorian became the Baby Yoda Show and the writing went down faster Snokes story arc.  Episodes four, five and six are very lame. Not much happens of any note apart from the dumbing down and degrading of the titular main character. Then came the last two episodes: utter garbage, absolute drivel. Such lazy, terrible and unforgivable writing.  The Mandalorian reminds me of The Boys: brave and bold in the beginning. Then turns crap.",10,positive,positive
"Why was there so much music this season? Were the first two seasons like that? I don't think so. I found it really distracting and aggravating to the point where I muted the show and just read the subtitles. It almost seemed like the music was being used to evoke the emotions and tone that the actors and directors were responsible for. Other shows use music much more effectively and with less of a heavy hand. I hope the next season does not rely so heavily on music. If so, I will be turning it off as soon as I hear the first set of bongos or wind chimes kick in. I loved the first two seasons but this one was almost unbearable to finish.",2,negative,positive
"Andor has superb actors and, like all Star Wars property, amazing special effects.  But it's biggest plus, is it's story. It's written by adults for adults. And that doesn't mean there's lots of cursing and sex, because there isn't any.  It means it has believable adult drama without all the childish slapstick that's in other Star Wars shows. Other shows are woefully lacking in story development and cater to a ten-year-old audience.  Also, it's a Star Wars show you can watch and enjoy without having read or watched all the comic book versions. If there are Easter eggs, they don't get in the way of the plot.  This is the only Star Wars property I've found watchable since Empire Strikes Back.",10,positive,positive
"I hoped 'Wednedsay' to be good but it turned out to be much more than that i.e. An absolute watch.  Coming to the story, it is suspenseful and gripping. And many a times it feels like Harry Potter because of the school, magic and solving a mystery due to which this feels a little predictable. Still it turns on sound to be different from it because of Wednesday herself.  The performances are great by the whole team and many of the actors we have seen before and their experience is enormous but Wednesday shines above all due to her mean attitude, mean expression, mean caring dialogues, mean cute dialogues and mean what not dialogues which surely make us laugh. I have seen Jenna Ortega in a movie previously named 'X' where she played a role of a very simple girl and in Wednesday she felt like a new version of herself and by this we can know what she can do ahead.  After Wednesday the character which I liked the most was the 'Thing' which made us awed did by just hand signals, Wednesday's roomate Enid was cute and funny too.  The CGI in Wednesday looks perfect. May it be the landscapes, animals, fire or the background. It lifts up the show.  Overall you can enjoy Wednesday with your family and have fun with Wednesday's mean attitude and her journey of solving the mystery.",3,negative,positive
"This show has been consistently riveting and the acting has been superb. There are very few shows that can keep you constantly enthralled throughout its entirety. I find myself anxiously awaiting for the next episode. This show is definitely grim and can be too heavy for some. I find it fascinating though, and eerie how they show what religious fundamentalism could lead to if given total power and control. There are fanatics in our current administration here in the U.S. and this show doesn't seem like a far stretch to what they would do if they had total power to enforce their religious beliefs onto all citizens. Women are already losing rights over their own bodies by men in power inciting the bible for the reason to do so. We need to watch this show as a warning of what could happen if we continue to elect Christian zealots to office. This idea they speak of to ""take back America"" and ""make America great again"" should be alarming everyone because it's them wanting religious dominance over us. Watch, learn, and resist.",10,positive,positive
"This show is good, and you may like it.  The performance of Jenna Ortega as Wednesday will be the only thing that will make you keep watching the show.  The show on itself is not that well written.  Like, there ar evampries, sirens, and other monsters out there, but we don't see them use their powers at all, else it would have been something.  The School feels like a budget Hogwarts(I feel like many will relate). And more plot holes and logic mistakes here and there. And the Climax was Okay, you may like it, But it's not the best.  The Whole show felt like a cheap budget remake of wizarding world, except All the fun stuff removed.  The story is predictable by some degree.  Finally, The whole show is carried by Wednesday, it also lacks lot of stuff, yet it's still interesting to watch and has captured lot of fans.  So you can defintiely watch it.  I hope they improve the writing on Season 2.",8,positive,positive
"It's like the Addams family , Harry Potter and a series of unfortunate events had a child. This is better than I expected! To me Christina Ricci will ALWAYS be Wednesday but wow, Jenna Ortega really brings it! It's witty and fun and is a fun watch. Im super excited to see where this show goes!!!  Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Adam's is truly fun. She nails the cold dark vibe to Wednesday , the no smile , the dark eyes and the iconic pigtails. The way she delivers her lines is a great start to this show. Her wardrobe is fun ( even if it's just a uniform). And we can't forget about thing! Truly a good time.",7,neutral,positive
I'm loving this! It's reminiscent of Dallas but far better! I love me some cowboys and Kevin Costner!,10,positive,positive
"This series has left me wanting more. I was hoping for at least 10 seasons, but I'll have to settle for 7. The first 4 seasons have been the best Crime/Mob show from UK I've ever watched! Can't wait for newer shows to be broadcast.",10,positive,positive
"The Mandalorian is like inspired from the real trinity except, it explains a simple bounty hunter's travels. He is a man who tries to stay alive just like each one of us does every day. This makes The Mandalorian closer to us and we feel it. Besides all of these, it is real Star Wars which means very heroic. Just give a chance, you won't regret it.",10,positive,positive
"So I just started binge watching this. I heard great things about it and started from the first episode on the first season and I am now on the fourth season. It's really hard to watch June. They focusing on her faces that she makes and her nose I just really think that they could've picked a better looking actress. I know that might sound rude or misogynistic, but it's just really hard to look at her and she makes these faces which are part of acting and are really good but they keep focused on her face and her nose sometimes for 20 seconds and her friend Maura is so unattractive. She's the same with the faces. It's really unheard of a show to do this well with two main unattractive women Elizabeth Moss is a great actor, but she is not who I would've picked. It is really sometimes hard to watch her. The show idea the book everything is great though. Her nose , a lot of her choices like getting people killed because she doesn't want to hurt aunt Lydia, stupid blood boiling choices.",1,negative,positive
"My favourite tv-show ever! Loving the story, music and the scenery is a massive plus.  Hopefully they continue with more seasons that are just as well put together.",9,positive,positive
"This show serves as a good way to remind us how sometimes we are so caught up in our own bubble o selfishness and materialistic stuff and we let ourselves be defined by it.  I really enjoyed how some characters realize of that and actually say something about it. I personally think that Mike id a great job with this limted-series and the music is really an adition that you taste in a very weird but satisfactory way.  Good Tv show, I reccomened it.",9,positive,positive
One of the worst series I've ever watched.  No story. No jokes. No thrill. No horror. No mystery. No love. No nature. No characters. No whatever. NOTHING.  And all the time the same bugging jungle music.,1,negative,positive
"Just when I was about to say this is my new favorite TV show, I watched the second season and I am so disappointed. The new characers are way less interesting, and it's as if everyone is driven by their horniness. Seriously did the writers think it's a good idea to revolve the plot around 2 pr*stitutes?.  The unnecessary sex scenes make it boring and it feels like they ran out of ideas. It's as if the team behind the production just wanted to see these actresses flash their t*ts.  The conflicts of the characters are just not as equally interesting for me to buy them unlike in season 1. In the second season, it's like everyone is just struggling with handling their libido and it keeps happening on the show. I really wish the writer becomes more inspired for the next season because I'm so disappointed with the downgrade that season 2 is.",8,positive,positive
"I thought they at least had a descency to say goodbuy to Henry's Geralt properly or include some cool action scenes in the last episode. Nope. Instead, they included some unnecessary annoying characters, unneeded scenes, and huge plot gaps. Tissaia's character is completely wasted. She supposed to be a strong and powerful figure. Instead, she is depicted as a weak teenage girl weeping for some dude. Yennefer was built as an ever-powerful witch in the first season and her character is completely wasted as well. Suddenly the elves are so powerful, while they resembled some homeless tribe during the first two seasons. Ciri is... I don't know what she is. Overall, the only good thing about this TV show was Cavill and his representation of a witcher. Since he is no longer in it, I will not watch it.  Also, Hissrich ruined all female characters in this show by horrible writing and poor casting choices.",3,negative,neutral
Loved reading the books and this series does right by them. Not an exact retelling but it captures the essence and manages to make it interesting. Well worth your time to watch.,6,neutral,positive
"The mostly excellent cast and crew are just that in their roles, costumes, set design, cinematography, editing, direction, effects, score, everything. It's just about two episodes too long though with story lines and subplots that do not need to be included. Especially for the supporting characters, who are great in their own performances, story lines, and character arcs with no need for the multiple back stories. That is minor compared to the outstanding performances of the leads the supporting characters. Even though they totally gave away the ending in the first episode and the twist was as predictable as the cliff hanger.",10,positive,positive
"Everything about this show is excellent. The acting, the writing, the direction, it all just works. Before season 5 I would have given this a 10/10.  However starting in season 5 they made the absurd production choice of adding in someone breathing strongly in and out into your ears for up to several minutes at a time every episode. It's extremely irritating, to the point where I have to deduct 2 full stars. Not to mention that it adds nothing to the scenes in which they chopped it in.",9,positive,positive
"I think it's a very good tv show, although I consider that the first 3 seasons are excellent and the fourth lowered its quality a bit, even so it has extremely good scenes. I think it's a very good tv show with very good performances by Elisabeth Moss, Yvonne Strahovski and Ann Dowd.",4,negative,positive
"Never thought I should write this, but this truly is the best series I have ever watched. Kevin Costner is amazing. I envy those that hasn't started watching Yellowstone ! they truly have a show coming",10,positive,positive
"Difficult to know where to start. Here goes: over acted, historically complete nonsense, script basic with cringe worthy philosophical anecdotes, dreadful background rock scene music, a predictable plot with subtlety of a sledge hammer. Don't bother.",8,positive,positive
"Started off slow, but by mid season one you will be hooked. I knew I'd like Kevin Costner as the family patriarch, but for me Kelly Reilly as the daughter Beth Dutton won my heart. The fact she spent most of the series with bruises, scars and cuts, but still be a bad-ass is amazing.  The turmoil of the sleezy unloved son and the favoritism of the youngest give the ""Godfather"" vibe.  The wheeling and dealing between the Duttons and the the Native Americans for land right steps up the political intrigue and when deals go bad, that's when the shooting starts!  Hoping for a long run of this great show!",8,positive,positive
"Sappy, poor acting, too much music and sound quality awful. 5 only because hoping 2nd episode is better. Like the concept, scenery...1 more chance.",10,positive,positive
"Honestly was skeptical over the casting choice over Ellie but i was proved wrong, Bella Ramsey embodies Ellie completely, Pedro Pascal is Joel and i couldn't imagine it any othe way  Coming to the show, it's intense and keeps you hooked right from scene one, the show is paced perfectly and the intensity and atmosphere the show is trying to create is achieved thoroughly.  If you've played the game there's a scene in the first episode which made me a bit emotional as it was perfectly done and elicited the exact kind of emotions the creators were trying to get from the audience  All in all its an amazing show, and i couldn't have imagined it better.",10,positive,positive
"Really surprised this is so highly rated, it is pretty average.  The dialogue is cringe with characters literally explaining what they are doing as they are doing it monotonously like it's edgy, it's not its basic.  Main actor is ok, the story lines somewhat interesting and the violence keep you watching but again the dialogue is so unnatural it ruins it.  And the tough girl routine in season 3 was awful, all her colleagues bowing to her greatness like she's wonder woman or something is pretty eye rolling...... and the accent woof.  Not sure I'll stick around for season 4, watch the wheel of time instead much better.",10,positive,positive
"Andor is without a doubt the single greatest thing Disney has ever done with Star Wars. This is the most grounded and serious Star Wars project to date. The sets are huge and incredibly detailed. The writing is simply genius. They managed to take the space political discussions from The Phantom Menace and make them interesting. The acting is simply phenomenal. Every actor is doing their absolute best to bring this story and their characters to life. This show is also great at building intrigue and tension. The buildup to the prison break in ""One Way Out"" is incredibly tense, as is ""Rix Road."" Then, in season two, ""Who Are Who"" can be genuinely scary at times. It's probably the most intense Star Wars has gotten (at least on screen). Every part of this show is gripping and absolutely stunning. It may be a slow burn, but it is certainly worth it.",10,positive,positive
"The Addams Family sitcom from the 1960s, set a standard that no subsequent adaptation could even come close to. Two seasons with a total of 64 episodes are one of my fondest childhood memories. Perfect casting, perfect morbid-comic atmosphere, brilliant dialogues and replicas, and seductive Carolyn Jones. An unforgettable experience, partly because it's so good, and partly because I can't forget something that I rewatch every couple of years.  Tim Burton is one of my favorite filmmakers. ""Batman"" (1989), ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990), ""Batman Returns"" (1992), ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" (2005), ""Corpse Bride"" (2005), ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" (2007), are pretty strong reasons why I had high expectations for this show. Unfortunately, it would have been better if I had approached the ""Wednesday"" series without any.  If it was supposed to be a comedy - it's not funny, if it was supposed to be a horror - it's not scary, it's not dramatic, it's not tense, it's not particularly imaginative. The Addams Family was originally conceived as ""a satirical inversion of the ideal post-war middle-class American nuclear family"", eccentric, morbid, and seemingly completely oblivious to how others perceive them. Wednesday is conceived as a girl who is extremely different from the students of a normal school, not an academy for fantasy beings. The other Addamses have no connection with their black and white ancestors, neither in appearance nor in character. The characters don't have the charm of the originals, the series isn't nearly as funny as the old one, and it doesn't have the iconic tune we all had our fingers snapping along to. Long story short, for a fan of the sixties series, and even compared to the films that followed in the nineties, the only thing this series has in common with its predecessors is the title and partly the image of Addamses.  On the other hand, viewed independently of its predecessors, ""Wednesday"" has its qualities. Impressive photography and use of color, interesting, if very poorly developed characters and, despite, in my opinion, a barely mediocre script, excellent acting by the entire cast. I was particularly won over by Hunter Doohan and Emma Myers.  And by far the strongest asset of this series, and the only reason why I didn't give up on it after one or two episodes, is Jenna Ortega, whose Wednesday completely overshadowed Christina Ricci's. It's not the Wednesday we loved in the sixties and nineties, but this new one might be even better. Jenna made this character her own, and I think I can say with certainty that from now on her performance will be the first thing most people associate with the mention of Wednesday, and even The Addams Family in general.  6,5/10.",6,neutral,positive
"I seem to be in a minority here, but I was disappointed with this umpteenth foray into the Star Wars universe. They took bits from virtually every SW film, put them in a blender, removed the Ewoks and added a Mini-Yoda modeled after the gremlin Mawgli and gave it a big budget.  For my taste I wish they had developed a storyline that was less juvenile and less predictable.",10,positive,positive

"Netflix really need to rethink and to do their best to keep Cavill and replace the writers/creators who really trashed the show, obviously they dont know the job of writing a good story, and they actually have good books and great gaming series to rely on. Instead they chose to mix some of their own, and the result is horrible.  Season 1 was ok and it's judt downgrade from that.  Now without Cavill and the bad writing, the show is doomed.  I didn't even continue beyond ep 1 of season 3, i just gave up on that show. Have nothing to waiting for, well at least i can always return to the books and game.",9,positive,positive
"The Last of us is my favorite video game and I was really excited for the live action to start.  I was afraid it wouldn't live up to my expectations, but I must say that I loved the first episode.  There were many scenes that looked exactly like the video game. For example, when Joel, Sarah and Tommy are in the car in the beginning, the way we see from Sarah's perspective and how the camera rotates inside the car to film Sarah! I felt like I as playing all over again.  So far, it's fateful to the video game.  I think the cast is well chosen, as I see and hear them I remember them as the video game characters immediately, and got flashbacks from the game.  The script is well written. Even the music is in it.",9,positive,positive
"Definitely the best video game adaptations of all time. You could never tell a 14 hour story in a 90 minute movie, It just works as a TV show, as you can tell all the important plots without leaving anything out. It allows you to dig deeper into each characters back story.  If you've played the games you will love this. Even if you haven't I highly recommend watching it, you will love it.  Both Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey are perfectly cast as Joel and Ellie. The supporting cast is equally cast.  The pilot episode is the best I've ever seen, it had me hook from the very beginning.  The Last of Us should serve as future reference to how video game adaptations should be made.",10,positive,positive

When I saw the trailer for this series, I was so happy and excited!  The series itself is very good, the casting is also good. I can say instead that I'm a little disappointed with the casting they did for Ellie, because the actress doesn't really look like the character in the video games, but Bella Ramsey, even if she didn't have the looks, managed to sell us Ellie through her behavior and her gestures!  Also PEDRO PASCAL IS THE BEST CHOICE for JOEL. And he played the role incredibly well! I can't wait to see season 2 and the other seasons that will be made!",9,positive,positive
"When Stranger Things first came out - entertainment weekly critics could not decide if it was good or not because it felt amateur movie making wise. But it was such a fun ride that the real regular viewers decided to embrace and luv it. This is exactly how The Witcher is - just enjoy the trippy wild ride and badass action scenes and adventure fantasy to enjoy this kick-ass of a series. Otherwise, if you are playing a sad critic who can't even figure out the timelines (watch Dunkirk to get the whole idea of timelines in advance movie making) of the show - well, you are being a sore loser (to put it mildly). Do not blame it on the show if you can't figure the story out because this isn't the kind of show that spoon feeds its viewers. This series is very engaging to its audience and it works great for me.",9,positive,positive
"While I'm not a fan of some of the teen cliches added in the movie, like the love triangle, the rest of this show is the perfect blend of comedy and mystery and horror. There are callouts and refrences to previous Addams Family movies and shows which fit right in and will make any classic fan happy. The actors absolutely KILL IT with their roles, feeling every emotion. The majority of characters are also relatable, especially if you have some trauma with parents.  I haven't seen anyone who I've shown this show to dislike it, and all of them (and me) have been hooked. The love and soul put into this show really shines through and makes viewing an amazing expierence. Highly recommend.",4,negative,positive
"Brilliant series portraying an exaggerated (but who the hell really cares) story set in an absurdly underused location and a period of time that is usually over looked (interwar period). When set up against the Period romantic dramas (Poldark) and faux page 3/Daily Mail portrayals of history (See, The Borgias, Tudors etc) it stands out in a very distinct manner. It contains romance, action, mystery, inter family politics and history in an almost perfect ratio and doesn't seem to have to stretch to ""tick"" these off. I found myself regularly searching things up on-line in a smug desire to look down on the show with a smart arse (Well that didn't exist) only to be, 9 times out of 10, sent packing with tail between my legs to the shows wiki page. Centring on a culture and accent that is still distinct and visible nowadays it's premise alone deserve applause. The performance of Thomas Shelby is quite literally a pleasure to watch. Cillian seems to saunter through the role with ease as the many layers of his character are regularly exploited and played with by the story. Fair enough, the accents aren't perfect but when you hear interviews with cast members, it is still a very impressive effort all round and with the perceived hegemony of the London accent over the British isles I think that shows like this are extremely important. I am literally waiting for a similarly imaginative but different show set in Sheffield or Bristol to come around. At a time when some people desire to destroy diversity and claim to want to return to a time period like when this is set I was also very impressed with the portrayal of the multiculturalism that was in fact as I researched very much rooted in fact. I am extremely intrigued to see where the writers take the Peaky blinders and on a more curious level to see if this has gotten traction in the US as I think it would be good to remind our cousins that our nation isn't just royals and cockneys in Grey old London Town. Putting the Sycophant/ fan boy part of me aside, If you can't tell, I am just really enjoying this series and I would advise you to take some time off Daredevil or Poldark or whatever and give this a try. More of this please.",10,positive,positive
"Binged the entire series yesterday. Highly recommended.  I've read all the Jack Reacher books, about 30 I suppose, and enjoyed them all. The Reacher actor closely resembles the guy I pictured when reading the books, unlike the Tom Cruise portrayal in a couple of movies. (Cruise is small -- Reacher is supposedly a giant of a man.)",7,neutral,positive
"I got completely sucked in from the very first second of this amazing show. I'm a post apocalyptic junkie, and this show- the acting, the writing- far surpassed all expectations I had. It's a must see, and a great replacementfor the EARLY Walking Dead Seasons before 'that"" story grew so stale and boring! I especially enjoy watching the relationships unfold and grow. I look forward to many more seasons, as I've connected with the characters and the overall story. I'd also like to shout out episode 3, as it touched my heart.  Keep it coming, as you have a dire hard family here that is addicted!!",9,positive,positive
"Yellowstone , worth a Binge if your looking for something to dig your teeth into. It's modern Cowboys crossed with the Mafia, and game of thrones without the make believe. It takes a while to build the characters but it's worth the watch.",10,positive,positive
"The casting is almost on point, but not quite there in my opinion. The guy who played Finley is a fine actor, but just didn't seem to fit the role, and the big let down was that they should have had Alan play both Joe and Reacher's roles, as they're supposed to be almost identical with only an inch difference in height. The flashback sessions, being modified for the TV audience, were a waste, as there was so much more to the story, that could have been fleshed out, particularly with the pretense of ""Reacher, doing what is right"", making the first run of the series not only true to the book, but far more understandable to the viewing audience, but as it stands, to non readers, this will make no sense whatsoever. With that being said, I am still looking forward to the next installment as i can only assume that the team will endeavour to be more true to the original stories as they progress through the series of books, (Two to three seasons a year thanks, to keep up with the ageing of the cast etc.). One can only hope at least.",8,positive,neutral
"To sum this up, it's not a straight up bad show, but a painfully mediocre one. Though if not for Cavill's brilliant portrayal of Geralt and the very obvious high production value of the show, maybe I would give this a 3. What they needed to do was to take it slow and do what they did in the first episode(which was the best of the season imo) i.e. start with Geralt's adventures and stories and build up the main narrative(a shorter, more focused one than what this show had) towards a longer season of 13 or 24 episodes. That gives us more time with the characters, and gives the writers more room for exposition and world building, which would have eventually resulted in a more coherent experience. For season 2, I'm hoping they would honor the Slavic foundations and the identity of the witcher series, improve writing and pacing, and deliver quality over quantity without a rush for completing the saga. They might need to change up the writing staff and rethink their decisions for this to happen; but looking at the fan reception of this season, I highly doubt that will happen.  Summing up...  Terrible writing, bad pacing, confusing timeline, no character development, lack of identity, but with a decent protagonist ??",1,negative,positive

"I enjoyed season 1 once I realised they were on 3 different timelines.  Season 2 meandered around with no real plot and it maybe because there's been a 2 year gap but Freya Allan is to old for the part of a 13-14 year old and the teenage 'angst' just felt forced and wrong.  Henry Cavil is great and very charismatic which is really the only reason I'm watching.  I haven't read the books or played the games so I don't know what the story is about, and after season 2 I still don't.",9,positive,positive
"The witcher starts with a promising first season. It focuses on Gerald of Rivia, as one would expect from the books and Video games.  The second season is still watchable and fun to the most part. Although it starts focusing to much on Main characters that nobody cares about.  The third season is a complete mess. The writing is so bad. Worst foreshadowing in the ""conspiracy"" episode by some dumb singers.  People are talking about events that you never get to see. The witcher himself has less screentime than burning candles and an equal amount of text. It was hard to watch because i was so bored. I am out at this point. I will not watch season four.",6,neutral,positive
"First off, I've not watched the original show and movies, so I'm not here to compare.  Wednesday has potential, and Jenna's acting is quite good. But the plot sometimes is just so random, seems to be there to fill the time, and many times an insult to any audience with any brain at all. The characters lack chemistry, none of the romance was believable.  The show is very much for tweens - for those targeted audience I'm sure it's a success. Anyone above that age range might find many flaws. Which is disappointing since the show has potential to be so much more, with Tim Burton's involvement in it.",1,negative,positive
"The Last of Us is, without a doubt, one of the best video game adaptations ever made. The world-building, the tone, the direction-it all hits exactly where it should. For anyone new to the story, the show is gripping and emotional. For fans of the game, it's almost everything we could've hoped for.  Almost.  My one real issue-and it's a big one for me-is the casting, particularly when it comes to Ellie.  Pedro Pascal does a good job as Joel. I like him as an actor, and while his version of Joel works well enough, I can't help but feel that Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones) would have been a much closer fit to the original character. He has that same rugged, broken energy that defined Joel in the game-physically and emotionally.  But the bigger problem is Bella Ramsey as Ellie. And I want to be honest here: it's not just the acting, though that's part of it. Her portrayal is harsher, colder, and more abrasive than the Ellie I remember from the game. Ellie always had an edge, but also carried a quiet warmth, humor, and vulnerability that made her lovable. In the show, those qualities are mostly missing. There's very little softness-she comes across as consistently aggressive and guarded, which makes it harder to connect with her emotionally.  On top of that, I simply don't think Bella Ramsey was a good visual or aesthetic match for the role. The original Ellie had a distinctive, expressive face that was both tough and endearing. Bella, by contrast, has a look that feels jarring in the role-unusual in a way that pulls me out of the character. And I don't think it's shallow to say that physical presence matters in casting, especially when the original material is so defined by a certain emotional and visual tone. There are countless young actresses out there who could have nailed both the acting and the aesthetic more closely. I disagree with the decision to stray so far from that. Looks aren't everything, but they do play a part-especially when the original character is beloved and so carefully crafted.  To be clear: the show is still fantastic. It's a must-watch. But the casting of Ellie, in particular, feels like a misstep in an otherwise near-perfect adaptation.",7,neutral,positive
"I'm always the first to extol the virtues of the books over the screen adaptations, but I don't think it's fair to dismiss something outright on the justification that ""Ugh, this isn't like the book! That character is supposed to be shorter and have dark hair!"" I have heard a lot of criticism for this show because the characters don't look/sound right. However, as long as they capture the essence of the character in their performance, looks shouldn't matter. And as far as I can see, most of the cast nailed it! Henry Cahill is gruff and jaded as Geralt, Anya Chalotra - heard most of the complaints about appearance around this actress - did a great job as the sharp and sensual Yennefer. And Jaskier was just a absolute laugh everytime he was on screen.  The writers did really well mimicking Sapkowski's witty dialogue (even though he clearly did it better). The main criticism I would have is... sometimes the special effects weren't very good. I'm thinking specifically the prosthetics for Torque the Sylan in episode 2 or the obvious greenscreen during the banquet episode. Bad CGI/effects can really take you out of the story, but I understand if their budget wasn't as generous for the first season of a Netflix show.  All in all, a really enjoyable first season... but I still prefer the books.",6,neutral,positive
"I like it but then I think it should be so much more.  The casting of Wednesday is perfect, don't like the casting of morticia and Gomez at all.  Tim burton directed this and all I will say is anyone could have directed this, what happened to burton? He has lost his style everything since he did sweeney Todd has been lacking in dark imagination. I liked the 1st episode and will give the rest a go. The girl who plays Wednesday is excellent in the role, not pining for Christina ricci, who is in this btw. However Angelica Houston truly made morticia something unique and natural, Catherine zeta jones looks like she is filled with Botox and makeup, this Gomez does not have the dastardly charm or good looks of the Gomez from the movie.

"A show that started well, only to turn into another boring story with a predictable direction.  The first season, unlike the rest of today's Star Wars products, was good, without the usual things that we are used to seeing in new Star Wars films and series. Even the second season was good enough to make you want to watch the next episode.  Then the third season came, the story takes the familiar direction we are used to, the series slowly becomes boring, unwatchable, and the Mandalorian slowly ceases to be the main character in his series.  The special effects are pretty good, the cast is mostly solid, there are exceptions of course, but overall it's not bad. The show was certainly not a masterpiece, but it was good enough.  There is nothing left of Star Wars worth watching, Star Wars films were a guarantee of good entertainment, and now it is just another tired franchise that no longer makes sense to watch.  It was good while it lasted, but this is clearly the end.",10,positive,positive
"I have to be honest and say that this series has so far been dry and slow as well as lacking in what we usually get in a Star Wars product. I have given it a chance so far and while I can't stand Michael Bay-type movies that have too much action with little story to tie it together, this series seems to lack the action to balance everything. That may be okay with a straight drama but it doesn't fit my expectations for Star Wars.  I expected also more exposition into the influence of the Empire and their oppression that leads to the birth of the rebellion. Instead, we see the interactions of different characters in whom are hard to take interest. Because its Star Wars I am generous with my rating but I hope to see better output as the series moves forward.",6,neutral,positive

"Even without a lightsaber in sight so far, this show contains such principal essence of Star Wars that it is instantly recognizable, yet it is such a breath of fresh air. Some will call it slow, but I call it purposeful and confident.  Just as my love for the cheesy dialogue and camp of the prequels does not detract from my love of the meaningful themes and mythological status of the original trilogy, my enjoyment of the adventure and action in previous shows and films does not detract from my fierce adoration for Andor's complex questions and statements about morality.  We contain multitudes, and so does Star Wars. I'm thrilled that we have another season of this treasure coming, and I sincerely hope LFL and Disney see the value in giving Star Wars more of the mature treatment this show received.",7,neutral,positive
"This show is absolutely in a category of a minority of tv show. GOT, TWD, the wire jus to name a few shows that has impressed me. Maybe I am bias because of being such a fan of the game.  I am a sucker for a great story, but add great characters, top notch acting and visuals. How can this not be a masterpiece.  So far I have only watched the first two episodes. After seeing the first episode I knew I would be hooked. The second episode came out last Sunday and it's a wrap, for me.  I believe anyone can appreciate this show. The story is not original. What's original is the way it is told. Because I know something about the story and these characters. It's hard not to want to spoil some things. But I won't.

As a huge fan of Naughty Dog games (Uncharted and The Last of Us) I was also petrified at the fate of this show; We all know how awful so many game adaptations have been.  Saying that I absolutely loved the film version of uncharted unlike many. I need not have worried! This show knocked it totally out of the park.  It is a huge reminder of just how good tv should be.  Even none gamers will love this show; scary, emotional and amazing SFX, acting & writing make this the best thing I have seen either in the cinema or tv in very many years.

"Having read some of the reviews on here, I was fully expecting this show to be a complete dud, but decided to give it a try due to the awards it has picked up.  How wrong I was, I think both seasons have been fantastic, I love how all the characters have their flaws exposed. Normally filmmakers and individuals try to cover those flaws or minimise them, but here they are laid out to be be feasted on by the audience. We all know that no one leads a 100% perfect life, and here we have primarily tourists, although some staff and locals too, exposing their thoughts and acts out to us.  In addition to the brilliant characterisations , we have sumptuous locations in both seasons that all add to the bacchanalian feast. I love how both seasons build up to a crescendo where I get the sense of characters just feasting and gorging on each other until it's just all too much. I can't wait for S2 episode 7 to drop at the weekend to find out more. I'm recommending this show to everyone I know, as long as they're ok with nudity etc.  Love it !",3,negative,positive
"Excellent casting, interesting characters and locations so gorgeous you could eat them are hallmarks of this great drama from Mike White.  Yes, it's about rich white people on holiday but it lampoons their petty concerns. But they're not caricatures. Valentina, the hotel manager in Sicily, is hilariously strict but grapples with what she will tolerate from guests' requests. Young wife Harper, played by the intelligent Aubrey Plaza, struggles with keeping her cynicism of her husband's wealthy friends in check. It's not a high action series. It's partly a travel show looking at lifestyles of the rich and famous. But it's more subtle.",10,positive,positive
"I've been reading Reacher novels for years. This series follows the flow of the novels and characters quite well.

"Its a no doubt that this series has a good production value, very good cinematography.  you will really feel like it was shot in 1920...great sense of costume, awesome selection of music..  for me it feels like a good looking 5 star dish, but not a good taste.  it falls from a very good height, if we talk about story..  the amount of ciggs smoke in this series, you can make a sitcom out of that money..",10,positive,positive

Who else should it be about? I mean, do not get me wrong, the rest of the cast was pretty awesome, too! My favourites were Emma Myers as Enid and Percy as Xavier. And Christina Ricci as a guest star? Amazing! Also, Catherine Zeta-Jones was a good choice for Morticia.  To sum it up, where Sabrina failed, Wednesday most certainly delivered. 10 out of 10.",10,positive,positive

However, Season 2 felt like a copy of Season 1 with no major changes or different circumstances. Honestly, I was so bored at times that I watched some episodes at 2x speed.  Season 3, though, pulled me back in with a very interesting plot and the return of some characters from previous seasons. So far, five episodes have aired, and it's getting really good.  I highly recommend watching The White Lotus if you want something entertaining that doesn't require deep thinking. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy!",6,neutral,positive

The evil facing those in the rebellion, with their backs against the wall who are fighting an insidious regime that has no mercy for those that will stand up and fight back any way they can.

I do not think that this show would be anything better than your usual teen drama show. To be fair the characters were not the greatest and there were some pretty cringy moments that I didnt like. There was some distracting product placement also......  But all in all this show was not bad and was actually pretty darn good. Jenna Ortega's performance is what really brings this show to life. It honestly might be the only reason I wanted to finish this show. I suppose there was some suspense at the end. But there were other times that reminded me that this is a Netflix teen drama. There was alot of fluff in the story that could have been avoided. It felt like they were just trying to throw you off of who is involved. Really relying on using a twist at the end that honestly didnt really work out.,9,positive,positive
"Season 1 was great, season 2 is an absolute mess. I liked Gerald as the lone warrior. But season 2 has Ciri on screen way too much, it's an empty and useless character.

"This is a great show. Technically it's beautifully made, the sets, the costumes, the writing is amazing, the acting is flawless, and the deeper meaning of the show seems timely, especially with regards to the treatment of homosexuals and what's happening right now in Chechnya, which mirrors what happens on the show. It also shows that underneath our veneer of civility, many people in this world are far from civil.  Even though this show is timely, it's not about our time, which seems to be the main complaint of the people giving this show one star. They didn't seem to actually watch the show pass one episode at most and if they did they don't see to understand it's deeper meaning. Bible versus are used for control, not because those using them are Christians. This is a show about women, but it's not anti-men. By far the two meanest and scariest people on the show was a women. The fact that most of the prominent characters are women doesn't make it anti-men. The men are in different positions than women but they are equally trapped by those positions. Everyone is suffering together and everyone has lost their humanity in this world because it's ripped from them, no matter who they are.  There is nothing in this show that could politically trigger anyone who isn't waiting to be triggered.",10,positive,positive

I would gladly watch The Witcher if it was just Geralt and Roach riding around in the swamp killing monsters for 10 seasons.

I think people just like it because the baby ""Yoda"" is cute.",1,negative,positive
"A show that manages to navigate between wholesomeness and utter cringe.  The acting and chemistry between the actors is brilliant.  But what I liked most, is the show's take on the idea of freedom.  On one hand, Quinn wants to stay on the island without his family. On the other hand, Rachel wants to break free from her marrige. The two have very difficult but similar struggles with different outcomes.  To sum it up - a great show I would recommend to everyone!!",10,positive,positive
"The best way that I can describe ""Wednesday"" is this:  They gave the Addams Family the ""Riverdale"" treatment, but in a good way.  Whereas ""Riverdale"" dramatically altered the characters that it was adapting, ""Wednesday"" keeps the titular character (as well as the rest of the Addams) intact and faithful, and then adds depth to what we already know. In other words, this show somehow manages to give the Addams a more believably human side without screwing them up. All that wonderful Addams Family weirdness is intact.  On top of that, there's good writing, good acting, good cinematography, a good mystery and an all-around classic Tim Burton feel. Oh, and Jenna Ortega freakin' kills it in the role of Wednesday.  So, long story short, if you love all things kooky and spooky, then this is absolutely worth your time.",7,neutral,positive
The storyline is good and the actors are also really good at playing their roles in this TV Series. I like how this is also a detective story about finding the monster and is really shocking to find out who it was and who was behind it. There are lots of trends going on about this movie and I am glad that a season 2 will be coming soon. Netflix did a great job and it stayed on top 10 for a long time now. There were logs of shocking and unexpected things happening in this movie like who actualky kills thw guy with a sword and who is actually the monster and who is behind it. I cannot wait for season 2 and possibly a season 3!,9,positive,positive
"I love this literally such an amazing adaptation from the video game with close to exact scenes and even just the setting and overall look and colors. The actors have such talent and I could not think of anyone better to play these roles. I am so excited to see the episodes to come after this first episode, I showed my friends and due to the hype were pretty interested in watching it, who have not played the game, and they were so entranced by the performance they were hooked! I definitely will watch the new episode Sunday with them as it was such a good experience, it is truly the best adaptation I have seen in a while!",10,positive,positive
I wasn't sure what to expect with this but I thought I would give it a try and I'm glad I did! This is better than I expected and has some interesting characters and storylines. I hope there's a season 2 coming up!,10,positive,positive
"I love Jenna Ortega as Wednesday. I didn't expect much from the series, and I confess that I haven't watched the Adams family movie, so it's a little difficult to report on Wednesday's fidelity to the original. However, I confess that I didn't expect much from the series, and that's why I can say that I was positively surprised. The series is aimed at young audiences, but even so it manages to please people of all ages. Furthermore, Jenna was a great choice for the role, she manages to express very well the meaning desired by the series. All of this leaves great expectations for the second season. Therefore, a series that I had no expectations for when I watched it for the first time, has now made me have great expectations for its second season. Let's see if they can meet this, or if they will be harmed by their excellent work in Season 1.",10,positive,positive
"It's funny how people either loved it or hated it.  I'm with the loving ones!  Most of the bad critics i've read are based on comparison with GOT and on high expectations not met, i'd say that's an awful way to build your opinion on anything...  I loved the show, it got me hooked really quickly and i think it would do the same to anyone trying it without expecting too much from a first season.  The only negative comment i would have is that some parts are hard to follow at first as time shifts back and forth at some points.  It's also a shame that it only has 10 episodes, i would have taken more!  ---  Edit: Everything i wrote about season 1 still holds, but the following seasons really disappointed me: crucial elements removed from the material source, poor representation of characters and events, and new things that don't make sense. I reduced my rating to 8/10, would have reduced it even more if it wasn't for the first season.",9,positive,positive
"Well, Mike White, I think you had the right idea at one-and-done with The White Lotus. Season 1 was deliciously savage class satire, rich with brutal takedowns and dark little laughs. Every week the tensions and discomfort built, till you knew it absolutely, positively *would* get even worse.  And, ooh, those Hawaiian sunsets behind all the snark and yearning!  Season 2 is just flat. A bore. For all the great casting and the history and beauty of Italy, you can only get hit over the head with the dis-pleasures of sex so much (as leverage, as addiction, for money, reeking of desperation, for revenge, incoherently wasted, impotent), before you tire of getting hit. And, this may be personal preference-but dangling one dead body in the opening minutes is more interesting than a passel.",6,neutral,positive
"This series is just boring. There are no politics, conspiracies, relationships of characters so well described in the book. Completely wasted potential. It's been a long time since I've been so disappointed with a series I've been waiting for so much. I'm so sorry HBO didn't pick up on this adaptation. Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, after series such as House of the Dragon or GOT, we expect something more from a fantasy series than meaningless mush about nothing! I'm really not surprised that Henry decided to leave this show. Too bad HBO didn't adapt this book. They would have done it 100 times better.",10,positive,positive
"Apparently they ARE listening to fans or there ARE fans at Disney or both. Amazing series , season 2 finale is breathtaking and emotional.",10,positive,positive
"I really love it and enjoy it too much. The series feels very natural, it's not the classic series or Star Wars movie when the heroes win without an effort, it feels very natural and mature and in some scenes it can briefly show very important things like the Imperial Oppression, torture, massacre and that's why is so good it really shows the day by day life in the galaxy by the Imperial Era.  The thing that i most liked about the serie is that it fills a gap in the chronology of Star Wars, and answer the question ¿How does the Rebellion started? Without coming to novels or other big Star Wars series, the narrative is so beautiful and perfect, the dialogs and characters feels so human, so perfectly structured.",9,positive,positive
"I have to say that I was really looking forward to Andor ever since I first heard about it. Then when I saw the trailers I got even more excited. I just finished watching it and it not only met my expectations but even surpassed them. It actually might be the best Star Wars series so far, or at least right there with The Mandalorian. The entire cast is great but Diego Luna is obviously the real star here. He is just fantastic as the lead. This may start a little slow but stick with it because it picks up in a hurry and the next thing you know you're completely hooked. It's already been renewed for a second season so I can't wait until next season and more of Andor!",3,negative,positive
"When we think that another series of zombies will come and just survive is the goal we immediately take a punch in the chin, THE LAST OF US brings a very rich adapted script that still has a lot to grow, we deal with family relationships and their trauma caused, we deal with biology and their fungi can cause, of politics and the police force and what the human being is capable of doing for an isolated epidemic cannot become a pandemic.  A super production with a very heavy cast, so much so that Pedro Pascal who plays Joel and Bella Ramsey, Ellie , worked very well on game of thrones together.  A beautiful direction full of details, which separated the big ( in both directions ) episode 1 , using an interview with an infectologist that brings us up to date on everything to come, then divides the episode into 2 parts, the first being faithfully and extraordinarily occupying the introduction of the game, the sequence inside the car lacks air of apprehensives . With a cinematic language that says a lot between the lines, the characters' own well-defined personality , production design that gives the impression of being dirty in the devastated post-apocalyptic Boston, Music that gives the series a great originality.  Everything to be a big name, they managed to respect the successful script of a game and made it richer. Let's hear a lot about The last of us.",10,positive,positive
"Into season 3 and after 2 fabulous seasons my expectations were high to say the least. Eight episodes in now and nothing has happenned of note I mean absolutely nothing. Yet It just does not matter I love every second of it. The lifestyle portayed, the scenery, the atmosphere, the acting, the cinematography, the subtle moodiness are all just superb. Every episode is riveting from start to finish and I cannot recommend this show highly enough.",5,neutral,positive

"Even a city slicker like me can see this show is full of holes and cow pies. Is it believable that a bunch of young, good-looking, busty chickadees can out-ride, out-shoot, out-drink, out-spit, out-gamble, and out-fight all the male ranch hands in the bunkhouse? The casting is bad, the writing and plot lines are formulaic, and the acting wooden. The product placing/cross-marketing (rodeo, music, etc.) also is annoying.",10,positive,positive
"(8/10 for season 1, 2/10 for season 2)If you're a fan of the books it's safe to assume you'll enjoy season 1 for the most part as it kept with the source material, with the parts that strayed not being overly terrible. Season 2 however was just an absolute embarrassment. I find it laughable that an ""adaptation"" can stray so far while failing so badly. The season 2 villain and plot was a disgrace to the books and I'm sure Sapkowski himself would be in absolute disgust if he was to watch it. Really surprised this show wasn't cancelled after Cavills departure as even he, being a fan of the books, was probably embarrassed to be involved in something that could made a complete mockery of the books. However it is likely it will be cancelled after season 3 if they keep up with this path of changing the already perfect source material that is there ready to be adapted into live-action. Makes me wonder if the writers even cared for the books in the first place as that last season was basically them giving the finger to Sapkowski and the wonderful stories he created.",1,negative,positive
"There's still the nerdy stuff on the side, and I guess it's amazingly accurate. However, there's a rebel movement being born here.  The looks are different, it is not the everyday action style we are so much fed up with these days, it's rusty, gloomy, even quiet.  The pace gets at you, but fortunately is a meaningful pace, and details matter. Every detail has its own details, there's depth in this thing.  Even the main character, hispanic, facing an empire... even that rings a bell.  If you can't see the three of them altogether, still give it a try later.  If you still don't like it beyond ep 4, guess that's it for you.",9,positive,positive

"Problems;  Confusing plot.  Underdeveloped characters despite lots of screen time.  Bag CGI especially Rare species the one with dragons, very bad. The dragon was talking but his mouth wasn't moving. (If the series wants to be in the same league as GOT they need to work on the CGI department)  Non linear timeline  Unnecessary nude scenes  Romance or Love angle moves way too fast especially that of Geralt.  Names and locations of kingdoms  this series is very confusing coming from a person who has neither played the games nor read the books and I'm sure I'm not alone. I hope they will make the plot more simple and less confusing in season 2. Henry Cavill is truly one of the things that will make me come back for s2.  Ohh I heard they are planning on making a prequel series hahaha Netflix already milking a series that is only started to find its footing.",9,positive,positive

"I must say i'm not impressed with this show, sometimes it looks like a fan show, but it has its good episodes, and as a huge star wars fan i have to say that i was hoping for more, but , well, the show itself isn't bad, what's bad about it is what's behind it, a company that bears a red lightsaber, a dark side company that supports censorship, Lucasfilm and Disney, shame on you! I couldn't watch this show normally after what happened, it was sad and made me sad, and i don't think i would ever watch any star wars feature under disney's production with the same eyes. Your political opinion doesn't matter now, what matters is the right of a person to express their opinion (you like it or not), the right of free speech, we should not accept companies like those censoring their actors and it WILL affect their productions, we should stop just accepting these kinds of actions just because the company is doing great material, we don't want to live under Disney's sith empire. Resuming, ok show, ruined by it's company's actions. 6/10, -10/10 for disney. I have spoken",7,neutral,positive
"Most reviews are focused on Reacher actually matching his description in the book and Alan Ritchson is quite good in the role, but Willa Fitzgerald, who comes across as both winsome and tough as a deputy, sometimes steals the show. Dimples and a southern drawl help. Can't argue that the show is great, but it is entertaining and one of the few new series I've binge-watched.",9,positive,positive
"I had no expectations when I start watching the show, but when I pass on the first episodes, I was really connected to the series, and one thing that surprised me is that it feels like watching some kind of Harry Potter movies like The prisoner of Azkaban.  The acting was good, the characters too. There are some things that really feels silly, but in an overlook, it works and the series ends being very funny and easy to watch. I was really surprised that I can't stop watching it until the end of the series and I am waiting the new season to know more about Wednesday.  If you have a little time, give an opportunity to this series and it hardly will disappoint you.",10,positive,positive
"Juat finished watching Wednesday series 1 , loved it absolutely brilliant , actors were great, story told very well and had my interest from the first few seconds The last episode left me wanting more , so really hoping for series 2, The chosen cast were perfect for each and every role would also like to learn more about morticia and gomez tine at nevermore before Wednesday and what other problems Wednesday faced before hand.  The director and production team made a brilliant job of the series and this is the first series I have ever watched from start to finish , can't wait for series 2 please.",9,positive,positive
"As beautifully a filmed, characterized and portrayed series done by a fine group of actors, individuals & personalities types I've ever watched. Have seen alot of westerns over the years but this one changed me. It also made me become historically aware. It moved me to several emotions, tears and all, a superb body of work. Meanwhile waiting for the ending was difficult to stay away from the media, be it Costner's personal issues or Sheridan's. Who knew, who cares, none of it was going to taint my view of Costner, been a fan for years. Sheridan as a writer, put together a beautiful epic. After wading through the marketing of how to watch it & finally put it all back together didn't affect my take away & felt it was seamless. It felt real. I wept alot & was saddened with Costner gone. Although, suddenly the appearance of Sheridan peppered throughout visually was obviously egotistical & a quick Costner replacement. Taylor's acting, his looks & the continual ""F"" bomb made it tacky, which makes me wonder who was really at fault here, Costner or Sheridan. It seemed like Sheridan had to overplay the testosterone card and some of his own identities. He is a fabulous writer, has a beautiful & brilliant eye but he is no Costner. Flaunting Hadid or nudie parties kinda made it cheap & common for a moment. Stick to writing Sheridan it's your forte. But anyway, thank you for making a ""real"" event, I got lost in it !!",10,positive,positive
"Finally, we have a very good sync between a book and a film/TV Show. Faithfully watched every movie and cringed at Tom Cruise being Reacher. Cruise did a great job of bringing action and humor but not the true character the author (Lee Childs) created. Will confess that the first season was stretched but hopefully that is because they wanted to keep subject relevant to just one book.  Very much look forward to next season and hopefully several more as there are many books to use for the script.  Highly recommend anyone loving this season to read the book it was based on (Book#1/The Killing Floor). And consider reading all the books (about 20+) as I'm sure they wont make a single season per book. Truly hope they incorporate multiple books into a season as sometimes the plot gets slow on the screen but never on the pages!  Great Job to Amazon as they keep bring quality products to justify my subscription to Prime.",10,positive,positive

"First, let me say that if you're looking for the comedy and playfulness of the original TV series or the movies (I haven't seen the direct-to-video version or the cartoon), you'll be looking long and hard. There are some comical moments, some outrightly silly and some dark humor, but ""this is not your father's Oldsmobile,"" as the saying goes.  The casting of Ortega was magnificent. She captures the spirit of Wednesday and does display emotion sparingly and only when appropriate. Catherine Zeta-Jones was a nice Morticia. I was unhappy with Luis Guzman until Wednesday breathed a sigh of relief at his acquittal (I won't offer a spoiler about it) and said she was sure he didn't have it in him to be a murderer. The look on his face was priceless. It was an almost, ""Well, I'm happy you're happy, but I thought I was all scary and such."" I think I laughed harder at that look than at anything else in the show.  It's a good mystery, a fair bit of horror, and a good dose of dark humor and sadness mixed into a thoroughly enjoyable outing. Since it ended on a small cliffhanger, I am hoping it doesn't get the Netflix axe treatment that so many decent shows seem to be getting. I look forward to a season 2 and am eagerly awaiting to see if they can capture the same spirit they started with.",10,positive,positive

"If you haven't seen it yet or haven't read the book let's try to set the scene without spoilers;  Mankind is failing, most women are sterile because of industrial pollution (or Mother Nature just having enough of us parasites). Birth rates are plummeting. An ultra religious cult see it as their God given mission to 'save mankind'. They seize power by staging a fake terrorist attack against the US government, impose marshal law and set about rebuilding American society.('War On Terror' anyone?) They use The Old Testament as their blue print, but with some totally wack interpretations and distortions. Fertile women become the property of the state. Brain washed and farmed out to the new ruling elite as baby makers, slavery and subjugation is all they can hope for.  Margaret Atwood, Canadian hero, social commentator, environmentalist, activist, feminist, tech inventor, business woman and visionary always maintained that this isn't sci-fi, but 'speculative fiction', things that have a chance of happening in the near future. Written in the '80's it's probably more profound now; the Neo Con Christian's have become a powerful force in US politics. Could there be a Tea Party without the ultra religious Republicans? Probably not. Maybe it takes a next door neighbour from Canada to really see what's happening with the totally dysfunctional family next door? It has always been a source of debate about how a country so entrenched in the ideas of freedom and liberal philosophy can also be the home of such obvious bigotry and divide? Surely teaching Creationism instead of proved science in some State's schools is a warning sign? Maggie may well ridicule this dogmatic un-thinking, however it's far from funny when she points out the possible end game and consequences for society and women in particular.  The book, although heavy going at first, is one of those you can pick up every few years and just dive right in (thanks to Una for making me read it back in '87). I was worried that this TV adaption wouldn't do it justice. How wrong I was. It's slightly different, and relies on a lot of flashbacks like the original narration; however this narration helps to smooth over the cracks nicely. So it still sticks faithfully to the principles and main events of the story, albeit in a roundabout 'more up to date' way. The subtle creep up and takeover of government and power has been well handled so far. I am enthralled, totally impressed and on tenterhooks with Bruce Miller's adaption. The direction is also smart, (the hanging scene seen from the back of a van was powerful stuff). Every image is a perfect composition, nothing is wasted, it's real art in the hands of skilled camera operators.  The feminism is subtle, not the clumsy and overt 'all men are bad, all women are good little victims' like of some of the more hardcore feminist literature. Maggie recognises that some women can be bad too, and some men will die to do the right thing, as you will see. Her book made a point that this could only happen if most women were willing parties too, and that a 2,000 year old book of moral tales can hold a massive amount of power when deliberately abused in the wrong hands.  It's also highly commendable that the cast are just 'normal folk', no super skinnies, models, hunks or pretty boys are in sight. This makes it all the more believable, it could happen to you and me. The lead, 'Offred' (Elizabeth Moss) absolutely nails it. No spoilers, but she will impress you with her canny nouse and determination to survive despite many obstacles and traps. I haven't seen one bad actor in here so far, they've obviously got bags of talent and emotional range. The design and resurrection of 'The Shaker Movement', as in the book, harks back to an American and European age of persecution and religious fervor.  Adhering to Maggie's descriptions of the colour coded dress, the production designer's subtle placement of now highly valuable Shaker furniture here and there helps; the muted drab colours, even in the opulent wealthy homes, take us sub consciously back to the times of Salem, witch trials, mass hysteria and life devoid of 'modern vices' like free speech, self determination, free love and modern relationships.  I can't wait to see how this progress', although I know how it ends (can't tell you, but get ready for some shocks!). It's been made fresh for me. I hope you will all love it too.",6,neutral,positive
"TLDR: avoid this if you're a snowflake.  I'm not into whatever current media promote the strong independent type of woman but Beth pull it of the fatale woman. Outstanding actress, hated her guts in first episode but well she's intelligent and doesn't have a blu' or pink reddish short hair and if is angry is so with a good reason so there's that.  Some on the left political spectrum get triggered by the ''patriarchy'' and land owner in a patriotic manner and some other thing but i couldn't care less to dig more Some on the right political spectrum get triggered by Beth, wrongly i would say.. sadly only after four season you'll learn the whole story.  About mr Kevin there's nothing much to say, his role is amazing his acting is magnificent and manly men like him sadly going extinct, we'll end up with hipsters gender blenders and feminine bois sooner or later.",10,positive,positive
"I love this serie, (hope for more) the Wednesday interpretation by Jenna Ortega is expectacular and the side characters are great. The Addams are one of my favorite of all time and Tim Burton directing is a need to see!!!!  The story is about Wednesday adventures, a book story to be published. The ""friends"" Wednesday have and the past stories she discover were great. Some mystery to solve and some lives to save.  Nevermore Academy is a good theme for monsters and outcast to ensure more chapters in this series.  I really recommend this series and enjoy watching it. With only 8 chapters is a great weekend view.",2,negative,positive
"This is a very poor follow up to season 1. Reacher looks like the comedy relief buffoon instead of the leader of his little group. Superwomen beating the hell out of muscular males while dressed in evening gowns and high heels? The book series took about 20 volumes to start going bad whereas this series was good the first season but went straight into the toilet in the second. Either Lee Child has suffered total loss of imagination and talent or someone else is using his name to try to get people to watch this crap. Too bad, it was a good idea to begin with but fails miserably. Don't waste your time on this,you will be very disappointed.",7,neutral,positive
"Reviewing episode 1 only, I hope the season follows suit because it began so well and I am completely gripped. As a big fan of the games which I played multiple times I did have high expectations and was a little bit scared of getting another mediocre Hollywood brain mash. Fortunately this isn't the case. The show isn't an exact copy of the game but how could it be? It wouldn't be exciting if we saw Ellie and Joel finding ladders like in the game would it. It has to be a continuous story. Regardless, I'm blown away and can't wait to see more. I am especially loving the use of light in the scenes of the first episode, it perfectly manifests that dusty run down city and sets the atmosphere very well. To conclude I'm a little bit obsessed so far.",9,positive,positive

"The Mandalorian (2019) is a series my fiancée and I thoroughly enjoyed and watched on Disney +. The storyline focuses on a bounty hunter from a clan that needs to go rogue when he discovers a baby grogu (or baby Yoda). He decides to not turn it over to the dark side and instead take him to a place he can be safe and use his unique powers for good. He will be hunter down unmercifully and at every corner. Can he avoid the dark side and find a place that can take and nurture the baby without being constantly under the attack of the dark side? This series stars Pedro Pascal (Wonder Woman 1984), Carl Weathers (Predator) and Gina Carano (Deadpool). There's a lot to love about this series for Star Wars fans. First off the Mandalorian himself is easy to root for. The special effects are out of this world. The side characters are awesome in both seasons. There's subtle and not so subtle references to the original movies. My only complaint would be some inconsistencies in storylines and some recycled plots used repetitively (like saving some small town from a viscous creature or overzealous villain). The ultimate conclusion was awesome. I can't say this series is perfect but it is definitely worth watching. I'd score it a 7.5/10.",10,positive,positive
"The first season got me totally! It was brilliant, the screenplay was multilayered, actors playing freely & lightly - a pure entertainment! Everyone could find something - you could follow the social stratification, you could observe a great clash of different characters. Satirical, sometimes grotesque, funny but sometimes facing you with serious questions.  Then I've started to watch the 2nd season and, frankly, I don't understand all the positive feedbacks - it's simply boring, a classical Italian soap opera, predictable scenes and behaviours... a mediocre actor's play... I've missed the unique atmosphere of the first season so I've stopped to watch it.",1,negative,positive

And she took down her videos, she honored the original material better in my view than this cheap Netflix knock off. Basically not an original idea. The YouTube did everything better in honoring the original material, this is just money grab from Netflix using melissahunter ideas.

"I continued watching beyond my wife giving up 20 minutes in and, boy, am I glad that I did!  This is an excellent series, blessed with 2 leading actors who make us believe in their relationship and in the difficulties that they face. You care about them and so you are gripped by their story.  But the series takes its time to give us many other characters. Every one of them is ""real"", even those whose role is to stand in the way of our heroes.  Also, the production standards are very high. This is especially noticeable when blighted urban landscapes fill the screen.  Now - I am not a fan of zombie movies, but that element of the story pales into insignificance amidst so much excellence.",9,positive,positive
I watched it all in one sitting. Really enjoyed it. Reacher dude is like someone who has Asperger's but is also a trained badass and investigator. He also plays it exceptionally well. There are a few technical faux pas (like who makes US Currency for one) that made me laugh but otherwise it is solid. Highly recommend it to both men and women. I think couples would enjoy watching it together.  After seeing this I can see why true 'Reacher' fans were so pissed at Tom Cruise being cast in the movie. This dude is bigger than Cruise from foot to knee!!,9,positive,positive
"What a waste of a promising theme. As I stood in front of my laptop screen I found myself wandering a simple why? Why am I watching this?? At first it was curiosity and IMDB rating. And the crime/mafia theme. After s01e02 I was convinced about the value of the show but stayed for my girlfriend's sake. Zero character building. Plot holes the size of craters. It almost looks like a parody show in the last 3 episodes of season 1, You don't know weather u should laugh or cry. Characters keep staring like zombies, smoking, posing like models in photoshooting. There is no acting, no directing absolute nothing. Only money. costumes, sets and music. Its a shame Sam Neil is in this. And actually the only one who tries a little acting. 2 stars is generous.",9,positive,positive
"It's just good. Well hyped, as usual for netflix, but definitely not a disappointment. I could've lived without it, but I do not regret watching. It's not a national treasure or something revolutionary like Arcane was. But it is really good. And not a timewaste.  Best for Harry Potter fans. It breaks the winter unspoken tradition of rewatching Harry Potter. You can mix now.  Actors are good, very well casted. Although, story is not perfect. As I said like five times already, it is good. But there are a few flaws. Old-gold scenario with the same old netflix fillers. For some weird reason they introduced Wed's Uncle. No back story, no development, and when the world needed him most, he vanished. Just made an episode out of it.  Despite all the fillers and cliche stuff, it is still watchable.",10,positive,positive
"Thanks to Ortega's wildly entertaining blur of arch broadness and subtlety, Wednesday gets to come into her own here. The series rarely feels derivative, and the predictable plot doesn't mean it's not entertaining.  With a script that doesn't take itself too seriously, a knowing wink at the audience, some genuinely scary bits and a committed and very funny central performance from Ortega that more than holds its own. Having outgrown her Disney Channel days, Ortega makes the Addams Family's now-high-school-age daughter the coolest humorless goth sociopath you'll ever meet, in a Netflix series that's more kooky than spooky.  My Rating : 7.5/10.",8,positive,positive
"I absolutely loved The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett.  That said, Andor is its own thing. I knew that Andor was well received and singled out as being more serious in tone from those TV shows. While it started out a bit slow this worked to the show's advantage because it allowed for proper character development for the characters surrounding Cassian Andor. By the end of the series I was fully invested in all of the characters.  Other reviews have gone into more detail about why this show is so great. For me, the highlights are the B-B droid and the prison arc.  My only disappointment is that unlike The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett there was no proper ending credits visuals or theme song. While I liked the brief intro to each episode I would have loved to hear a full version at the end of each episode along with concept art.  Full disclosure for context: While I've seen all of the movies in the Star Wars series I was never a huge Star Wars fan until the Disney series. I feel like TV is the best medium for Star Wars, especially live action, though I intend to check out the animated series in between releases. So far I've seen The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Andor, and part of Ahsoka have enjoyed them all.  I found the acting and visuals of the original movie trilogy to be heartfelt and original while suffering from being quite silly and poorly acted especially when watching it for the first time in my adulthood many years after it was released.  The prequel trilogy came out during my childhood but I didn't watch it until much later. Sadly I found it poorly written, poorly acted and had an the over reliance on CGI.  The sequel trilogy came out during my adulthood and was actually my first true introduction to Star Wars. I found it to be the easiest to relate to with it having the best acting and visuals. But when I realized how much they were repeating from the original trilogy and how lacking it was in originality my opinion has been downgraded.  I liked both Rogue One and Solo.",8,positive,positive

"Great watch! Something about this show felt very realistic and not ""over the top"" at all. If you've ever felt out of place while on vacation or just wished you could go home, you'll find this very relatable throughout. The characters had a lot of depth with no clear ""good guy"" or ""bad guy."" Overall, it was very entertaining throughout and had a satisfying ending. It was predictable towards the end, but I enjoyed the acting and storyline quite a bit.",8,positive,positive

Season three definitely has some intriguing elements early on and even after some plot lines are fleshed out there's still an element of intrigue. However there's a few episodes where nothing really happens and things get a bit dull. One issue with this season is the lack of comic relief. Jennifer Coolidge was great at providing comic relief especially in season two. My biggest issue with this season is the insertion of incest into this series. Who in the hell thought this was a good idea? It's completely disgusting and took me out of the mood to watch this. Whoever wrote this and whoever approved this needs their heads examined.,1,negative,positive
"Despite presenting a set of largely unlikeable characters behaving badly in luxurious settings that most of us will rarely or never experience, ""The White Lotus"" is gripping and involving drama. Its strength lies in its singularity of purpose created and sustained by Mike White's deep involvement with all aspects of this production from the writing upwards. This is aided by a wholly convincing and excellent performance from the entire cast. As is made explicit in a scene hommage in the second series, this series shares much of the same concerns that fascinated the great Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni and knowledge of Antonioni's movies and sympathy for that director's vision adds a great deal to the enjoyment of ""The White Lotus"" even though it is far from necessary to fully enjoy the show. Of the two seasons broadcast so far, I enjoyed the first more than the second, partly because it was fresher, but it's easy to see why others might feel the reverse. Both seasons are variations on much the same themes, sharing structural elements. Great care is taken in integrating dramatic symbolism throughout - it's very easy to see why critics have fallen hard for this show, it is very seductive for anyone versed in the history of drama in all its forms. This care extends to the musical score and cinematography. In the end, despite being well aware of the effort made to make the characters as well-rounded and humanly relatable as possible, I still had the sense of an outsider's view into a type of world that I'll never inhabit, but that didn't diminish the fascination.",3,negative,positive

All episodes represent something from the original star wars saga, you will feel nostalgic, also very refreshing jokes and funny moments paced at the right time, Favreau is the master of setting the mood for every scene. Acting is also on point! This is better than I was hoping for, fantastic show even for non star wars fans. I am loving it and hope it stays at same production quality levels through the seasons! For me, series of the 2019...",10,positive,positive

It was insulting to my intelligence to continue watching this filthy stupid collection of bad acting , a terrible script, and the nastiest things any teenager could come up with to make a show.

"You can tell the creators really put the work in. The photography, the music, the cast.  Season 1 was funnier but weirder sometimes, but very entertaining.  Season 2 was just beautiful, the plots so good, the acting.  And a detail worth mentioning, not much ideology involved, and when it was, you had counter arguments as well from other carachters, so a healthy trade of ideas. Not preaching at all.  Set in a tropical resort, it follows the exploits of various guests and employees over the span of a week.

"Somebody up at Disney thought that a prequel show based off of a side character in a prequel to Star Wars would be a good idea. The craziest thing is, they were right! Andor tops every other Star Wars television show in terms of acting, writing, and cinematography, each shot and line of dialogue purposeful and well-paced. Diego Luna as the titular protagonist does not disappoint, but that is not to say he overshadows the other characters and other actors that work alongside him. Stellan Skarsgard, Genevieve O'Reiley, Fiona Shaw, and Andy Serkis all have outstanding performances in this politically charged sci-fi drama.",9,positive,positive
"I gave this 5/10 because I enjoyed Season 1 and looked forward to Season 2. Maybe Season 1 was also bad and I just missed it. But I'm 7 episodes into Season 2, and it is quite a stinker. The wildly implausible parts of the story I could maybe get over if the acting and writing weren't so bad. Alan Ritchson is not a good actor. But he is still fun to watch because he's just so physically striking (no pun intended) and the fight scenes are very good. But in between the fights he is a bad actor who is saddled with some truly silly/awful/cringey dialogue. The other actors/characters in the 110th are also not good, nor helped at all by the writing. The actor who plays Neaghley is particularly hard to watch. The only good acting in the entire show is the guy playing Rizzo, the NY cop.",9,positive,positive
"This is a neowestern show that kind of speaks to the deepest instincts of men how awesome, how manly, how freeing and at the same time adventureous the modern cowboy lifestyle can be.  Kevin Costner is fantastic, so is most of the cast. Rip, Kayce, even Jamie are perfect in their roles, from being loyal to the family to questioning all that this family stands for.  So what's the downside? Well, for me it's Beth. Or her actress. She is unbearable, and the acting is over-the-top every single second. Everything she does, everything she says, every movement, gesture and even only a look of her is always sooo theatrical, so unnecessarily dramatic, it's pure cringe a lot of the time. Same goes for her behaviour towards Jamie. Already by season 2 it's extremely annoying, and having it explained later doesn't make a difference.  So it's easily a 9 or 10, but thanks the to role of Beth it's an 8.",9,positive,positive
"Not just the best Star Wars show yet, it's one of the best anything that's Star Wars. Mandalorian is fine and fun, but Andor has a level of maturity and competent writing that the franchise desperately has needed especially since Disney bought it. Finally we get proper presentation of the nitty and gritty of this universe.  This time around, there seems to be actual though put into the writing and characters, and they don't do stupid decisions like how we've seen especially in the last couple of shows with Book of Boba Fett and Obi-Wan Kenobi. The setting and characters feel human and believable, and the message behind the show is presented in a gritty but satisfying way that doesn't become too corny. And best of all it shows how rebellions can also have an ugly side to them.  Highly recommended even if you're not a Star Wars fan.",10,positive,positive
"I have read all the books and played all the games and whilst this isn't perfect, it's a great starting series. My biggest gripe about this was the monsters everything else is great. Hopefully Netflix give them a bigger budget so they can sort the CG out and make the monster look better. Henry Cavill as geralt is amazing he was definitely the highlight of the series and I thought he wouldn't be Geralt but you can tell he is a big fan! Awesom performance from start to finish. Now I'm not a great writer but reading some of the reviews I was embarrassed for them and thought I have to give my two cents. Yen also has a really good performance and I know the producer is a bit of a crank but this is a much watch!! I thought it would be a lot worse.",8,positive,positive
"Me being a huge fan of Tom Hardy thought I will give it a go only because of him. But right after the first episode, I felt may be there's no need of MR. HARDY as MR. MURPHY is right up there. I am watching this show on repeat and All I can say is that after Breaking Bad my search is over for a show which promises everything I look in a show. The dialogues, humor, acting, thrill and entry of Tom Hardy in second season has made it even more interesting.Recommend this to everyone who is looking for some goosebumps watching TV. PEAKY BLINDERS is one great show from BBC and I wish the entertainment level never comes down. INCREDIBLE!!!!!",9,positive,positive

I love that all the actors have chemistry and sentiment is not wasted on supporting characters who sometimes don't have enough of a storyline to care what happens to them. The humor comes in at the right time and the fight scenes are exquisite. I appreciate that they include women in the fights as well as giving them positions of power. The monsters are terrifying, fun and creative. I never got a chance to read the novels but I hope the OG readers have not been disappointed by this live action retelling. I've re-watched the show multiple times and I can't wait to watch more! If you loved the movie Willow, you will love this.",7,neutral,positive

"The season is sheer class which grabs your attention the moment you start seeing it. The good thing about Peaky Blinders is that, it grows with time. The directors have let it grow slowly and have been good at not over doing it. It looks natural and you find it close to reality. Cillian Murphy has been outclass in his performance as a lead actor. Hez cool, classy and is well articulated for future. This is his strongest performance in his entire career and I've started loving him for that. Folks watching Narcos and other seasons on gangz will find this appealing in its own way. A must see for folks interested in top quality British Season!!!!!",3,negative,positive
"The Last of Us series, based on the critically acclaimed video game, offers a hauntingly beautiful and intense portrayal of a post-apocalyptic world. It follows Joel (Pedro Pascal), a hardened survivor, and Ellie (Bella Ramsey), a young girl with a mysterious immunity to the deadly infection decimating humanity. The series excels in blending high-stakes action with deeply emotional character moments, capturing the complex relationship between Joel and Ellie as they journey through a shattered world.  The show's strength lies in its compelling storytelling, which maintains loyalty to the game while adding fresh perspectives. The performances by Pascal and Ramsey are raw and impactful, making the audience care deeply for their characters. Visually, the series is stunning, with meticulous set design that brings this ravaged world to life. The pacing may feel slow at times for those looking for constant action, but the story's emotional depth and tension are well worth it.",9,positive,positive
"Edited to add - Judging from episode one, season two is going to be great! Some very dark comedy here, beautiful sets and art direction. Fans will be pleased. Hopefully no gratuitous shocker-disgusting scenes!  This is one of the best-written, -acted, and -produced series in recent memory. It deserves all the accolades it has received. Special mention to the musical score and Murray Bartlett's performance.  But for me personally, the rimming scene and the defecation scene were two bridges way too far and added nothing good. John Waters would have been thrilled.",8,positive,positive
"While this might please some Star Wars fans, I found this extremely flat. The writing is rather poor - I could not get invested in any of the characters - it just felt very wooden. There just doesn't feel to be any stakes in the show. The setting is cool, Baby Yoda (Grogu) is cute, but the show feels like it has absolutely no depth, as are the characters.  I'm baffled as to how it's so popular and its high ratings. In comparison to the Witcher, I expected it to be similar, given similar popularity and frequent comparisons. However, while witcher is a flawed show, it clearly has depth to the characters stories (the characters grow and develop), there are themes (oppression, imperialism, etc). This had none of that. It felt very artificial. Very disappointing.",1,negative,positive
"Or all three? I'm going to give a pass to the actors because they are doing what they can with what they are given. Each episode could be half an hour if they eliminated the meaningless meandering pauses. I can see the director now ""Ok, now I want you to mumble & meander, look off into the distance, give long pauses so we can stretch this out"". Jennifer Coolidge is a talented actor & has done great work in the past. Is playing this role as a one dimensional stoned zoned out flat toned zombie her idea or the directors? Half the storylines are irrelevant & going nowhere. This may be the most boring television show Ive seen. It's going nowhere , & talking a long painful time to get there. If I had to guess, it appears that they likely had a limited time on location at the resort, and therefore had little rehearsal or development time. Likely the worst HBO show in history , & possibly the worst from any outlet. And we get that the newlyweds got the wrong room & aren't happy about it. That's a 5 minute storyline , not a 5 episode storyline.",1,negative,positive
"The first season was a breath of fresh air compared to the utter disaster that was the sequels. It was interesting, fun and exciting. The second season also had some pretty fun elements... but the third.. Seems like it completely lost its path. The plot just isn't there. Nothing coherent. Just several seemingly independent stuff happening with no meaning what so ever. It's a mess.  I would recommend everyone to just skip the third season, I'm not sure I will finish it cus I doubt they will be able to reignite my interest.  Such a shame for a show that started out great. To me this is as boring as the book of Bobba fett, which was terrible.",10,positive,positive

"I assume the script and story line are base on the game, which I know nothing about. But watching it as a show their countless errors. At one point a woman says he is capable but he is not, not even close. He makes too many technical mistakes. Example is that instead of arming himself with the proper weapons, he does just the opposite. At the home of the Survival guy was an armory but instead of taking serious weapons and supplies, he does just the opposite. He reason for having a gun is combat but he takes a six shot revolver and a Hunting rifle instead of a Hi-Capacity simi and a hunting bolt action rifle instead of a Assault rifle of which their were many. From skirmish to skirmish he leaves guns and ammo while sticking to all the wrong weapons. He leaves food and supplies everywhere taking nothing along. He is no Scrounger which is the only way you could survive for all those years. He acts like he is taking a walk in the park. She saves his life and he takes her gun, why. He then tells her to keep it in her bag, a good place for it. Very disapointing and not a NINE by any means.",10,positive,positive
"The Last of Us TV series delivers a gripping and faithful adaptation of the beloved video game franchise, capturing the essence of its post-apocalyptic world and the complex characters that inhabit it. From its breathtaking cinematography to its meticulously crafted storytelling, this series immerses viewers in a harrowing journey of survival, love, and redemption.  The performances of Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie are nothing short of phenomenal, capturing the depth and nuance of their characters' emotional arcs with raw authenticity. Their chemistry on screen is palpable, anchoring the narrative and driving the heart-wrenching drama forward.  The series stays true to the spirit of the game while also expanding upon its lore and character development, offering new insights and surprises for both fans and newcomers alike. The production design flawlessly recreates the haunting landscapes of a world ravaged by the Cordyceps fungus, instilling a sense of dread and wonder with every frame.

"The actress portraying Wednesday is the saving grace. Production quality seems good enough, with some good contrast between Wednesday and other color palettes. Otherwise, it's a tween drama masquerading as an Addams Family story. The story could have been better with a little less predictability and the unnecessary modern-revisionist pilgrim history that was shoehorned in. It was a weird attempt to walk the narrow line of not offending most of the audience while still appeasing the self-righteous Hollywood powers-that-be. The reviews comparing this to bad CW shows are spot on, but I did want to at least finish the series. The 12-17 y/o minds may be the targeted demographic.

I was excited for Wednesday but felt really let down by this series adaptation. Don't get me wrong Jenna Ortega plays the part perfectly. There isn't a better actress to fill Ricci's shoes. Still the show had a Harry Potter/ Sabrina/ Monster High feel to it. I don't mind campy but it was a bit much. Poor casting for Gomez hurt the epic romance of Morticia and Gomez. I almost wish they wouldn't have been included. Jenna Ortega Was the only solid casting and the acting in the show is somewhat lacking. It seems like this series is made to cater to kids and teens. Wednesday just doesn't live up to the hype.,3,negative,positive
"As a rule, I very seldom watch movies or series based on books that I have read. Purely because I'm invariably dissapointed by the lack of correlation between the book and the movie/series. Being a fan of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels, the same can be said of the Jack Reacher movies, casting Tom Cruise as a very unlikely candidate in the title role. This was mainly because his short stature certainly did not fit the description of a 6'4"" giant, as in the novels.  However in the case of this series, I was pleasntly surprised by not only the casting, but also the correlation between the series and the actual novel ""The Killing Floor"" by Lee Child.  The action sequences and pace of the plot had me rooted to my chair. I eventually ended up binge-watching the entire series over two days.  This was definitly worth watching and I certainly hope that there will be further seasons.",10,positive,positive

"First off, I didn't dislike the show and I did find it fairly entertaining. The problem is that the entire first season feels like a series of ""monster of the week"" for Geralt while the other important characters are simply doing their own seemingly unrelated stuff.  The season doesn't really start to make sense until the end which is a huge waste of time. The entire 8 episodes could probably have been cut down to 3-4 episodes. The first 2 episodes could be the stories of the two female characters and how they are connected to Geralt and the 3rd, and possibly 4th, episode could have been what happens in the last 2 episodes. The interconnected events like slaying of certain monsters to gain allies and such could have been handled by a 2-5 minute conversation instead of 30-45 minutes of an entire episode.  This way you'd have 4-5 episodes left to actually start telling the story instead of wasting almost the entire season on what essentially feels like a prologue.",10,positive,positive

"Alienation comes in all shapes in this marvelous and inequivalently hilarious mini-series. Barring the Zen-like setting of a posh tropical resort, the tensions run deep.  This series shows how different the classes see the same situations occurring. Even members of a family and their daughter's guest can't get on the same page when it comes to relaxing and just laying back and enjoying life. The staff of the hotel sees their guests through some shades of contempt. But all must perform to follow guidelines on behavior and personal needs.  I was mostly unfamiliar with the cast, with the exception of Connie Britton. The entire cast rates a thumbs up for the portrayals of their characters. The writing is first class, bring the human foibles to a head.  Music is spot on to suggest the serenity of the islands and the tensions of the characters. The imagery of the rolling ocean and the waves crashing in and out is an allegory to the feelings of loneliness and desperation experienced by the guests and staff of the resort.  Well worth the time to view and, thankfully, the mini-series has been renewed for another season. As I understand it, the series will be set in another location with a different plot.",7,neutral,positive

The whole two seasons have been a joy to watch with great nostalgia, some fantastic characters and actors and the finale was just sensational. I have watched the last ten minutes now over 20 times.

"Quite tedious so far, its barely Starwars at all. The main character is a badly acted unlikeable emo with a near constant scowl on his little face. Started well in the hope of a decent gritty starwars show but then tails off badly episode after episode. There is zero tension and zero suspense as the story is trite and plodding, we have seen it all before. Andor is a 6 episode series that has been dragged out into many episodes of filler and boredom. When you watch an entire episode and all they have done is spend 20 minutes walking past some goats then something is wrong. Still, some nice scenery if thats your thing. It may well pick up in the second half of the season.",10,positive,positive

"Watched this show in 2022. Many people hyped it up mainly through the viral dance and I wanted to know if this show was worth the hype it was getting. Once I finished episode 1, I knew this would be a show for me coming from a fan of The Addams Family. Because the first episode had me hooked, I continued watching it and immediately once a love triangle happened, that's where I was like, ""this is highly unnecessary."" I get that broken trust is an aspect that fits well in the show, but there are ways to better execute it like through close friendships. While I wouldn't consider this Tim Burton's BEST work, I do consider this a great show! It is worth watching in my opinion!",10,positive,positive
"Andor is a breath of fresh air that Star Wars fans both old or new and can massively appreciate. Already being described as the best Star Wars project in years, the show visits the origin story of Cassian Andor (a fan favorite from popular 2016 Movie Rogue One) and how he ended up getting recruited by the Rebellion. The show initially is quite a slow starter but its upward climb and the momentum it gains after the third and fourth episode is phenomenal. The later episodes are brilliant by the standards of critically acclaimed television with the level of dialogue and acting by the likes of Diego Luna and Stellan Skarsgård helps to create a tension in certain moments which can only be matched by shows such as ""Breaking Bad"" or ""Prison Break"". The show visits the dark and gritty inner workings of the early rebellion, something we were yet to see in live action. The writers of the show take a big risk by not connecting the show to the main Star Wars story line but instead exploring stories outside the comfort zone of the average fan. The risk, however, has well and truly paid off.",10,positive,positive
"Beautiful scenery, intriguing storyline, fantastic cast.",7,neutral,positive
"If you're looking for a realistic show, this is not your show. If you can suspend reality then you'll overcome the biggest hurdle I had.  The premise of the story is decent. On the whole, the acting is solid. The performance by Willa Fitzgerald (Roscoe) as the female lead was the most refreshing female lead I've seen in a long time as she mostly behaved like a normal human being. Disappointingly, the performance of Maria Sten (Neagley) was cringeworthy. Fitzgerald played modestly, relatable, confident and strong in that she stood by her conviction without being a 2D ninja warrior.  Alan Ritchson (Reacher) played the role as charming, arrogant and highly confident. It was a fine line between likeable and not. Had Netflix made this series, Reacher would have ticked a box of some sort. In this series, you felt that box ticking was not important. Mind you, one of the black characters was poorly done. Without any spoilers, they were totally shallow. I would have preferred more nuance.  The real problem with the series is the lack of logic. People are being murdered everywhere by professionals. Crack shots and psychos. However, they never seem to be able to kill the three lead characters. This made no sense.  The series is best summarised as follows. The series avoids woke tropes. Reacher is not emasculated in any way. The acting is decent (mostly). However, the logic sometimes fails. Don't look too hard and you have a good series. It was mostly great.",5,neutral,positive
"As an enthusiast of the last of us games, my expectations were naturally high for me to consider this adaption to be impeccable. The geography, the infected, the characters, the story line, SFX, the utilization of weaponry, the body language and movements of all subjects within this world, the backstory, all of it has to operate together like a well oiled machine for this adaptation to really stick. AND BOY DID THEY DELIVER! 2 episodes in and its utter perfection. They made some changes to how the story moves on but not too much where it sways away from the true nature of the story. It also makes it exciting for individuals like myself who have played the games in the sense that it offers something new and exciting. Outstanding so far.",10,positive,positive
"Heard about It from a friend, and decided to try once I saw the cast. The whole cast kills on this show, everyone jells very well. It's got plenty of drama, action and some humor sprinkled in. If you're looking for a binge worthy show definitely put Yellowstone at the top of your list!",10,positive,positive
"The Disney corporation desperately needs to put the writers of Andor on top of all Star Wars projects from now on. If they have a care and respect for the Star Wars universe, they need to put these kind of people in charge. They might even redeem themselves after the disastrous humiliation of the past 15 years.  Andor has a heavy feel to it and you might need to be a bit patient for the story to reach fruition. Every character feels like a real person within the universe. The Empire feels again like a legit threat with intelligent and ruthless people. The struggle feels real and it becomes easy to emphasize with most characters. I highly recommend the show to all that love deep, intelligent storytelling.  Everybody and their grandmothers are so joyful that the era of ignorant hubris is coming to an end. Finally people are optimistic again for entertainment that respects and values customers and fans.  Here's to hoping! Cheers.",10,positive,positive

"This has to be one of the best Netflix shows in the last 24 months. All ages can watch and enjoy. I can't wait till next season. Actors are well casted, scenes are great. I would urge all to watch one episode and from there I will guarantee that you will binge in 1day. Just wish they did more than 8 episodes. Hope you all enjoy. !!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! As nyt said The news that Tim Burton would be directing half the episodes of ""Wednesday,"" Netflix's new dramedy about the Addams Family's death-obsessed young daughter, piqued interest. It would be Burton's first real television work in nearly 40 years, since he directed episodes of ""Faerie Tale Theatre"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents."" And Burton, an often magical storyteller attracted to off-kilter material, seemed as if he might be a good match for Charles Addams's macabre cartoon family.",4,negative,positive
Great first season ! Season two is just torture. Both literally and figuratively. The actress is good but her character begins to act completely unrealistically in a story like this one. From there - and the fact that the authors love to add over the top sadism in their story - it begins to be difficult to watch !,8,positive,positive
"Wednesday brings the iconic Addams Family character to life in a fresh and intriguing way. Jenna Ortega's portrayal of Wednesday Addams is a standout performance, capturing the essence of the character with precision. With a touch of sarcasm and a dark sense of humor, this series delivers an enjoyable and entertaining experience.  The show successfully blends the old and the new, paying homage to the original Addams Family while embracing the modern era. It strikes a delicate balance between the macabre and the relatable, presenting a storyline that engages both the younger and older audience. The witty dialogue and clever plot twists keep viewers hooked from start to finish.  Of course, every series has its flaws. Some viewers may feel that certain casting choices missed the mark. Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia and Luis Guzman as Gomez may not have delivered the chemistry one would hope for, feeling slightly out of place compared to the rest of the talented cast. However, Christina Ricci's appearance adds a nostalgic touch and brings a sense of continuity to the Addams Family legacy.  The visual aesthetics of ""Wednesday"" deserve praise, with Tim Burton's episodes showcasing his signature style that fans have come to love. The CGI effects are well done, and the soundtrack adds a whimsical and atmospheric element to the series. Memorable moments, such as Wednesday playing ""Paint it Black"" on the cello, leave a lasting impact.  While some episodes may lack the distinct Burton touch, the overall story remains interesting and humorous. Wednesday's deadpan remarks and sarcastic quips provide many laugh-out-loud moments. The dance scene is an epic highlight, demonstrating the series' ability to captivate through creative and well-executed sequences.  With an 8/10 rating, ""Wednesday"" is a show worth watching. It may not completely capture the charm of the original Addams Family films or please every viewer's expectations, but it offers a unique and entertaining take on Wednesday Addams and her world. It leaves you eagerly anticipating a potential second season, hoping for new casting choices that will bring even more depth to the beloved characters.  So, prepare to embrace the strange and deranged, as ""Wednesday"" takes you on a captivating journey that will leave you craving for more.",3,negative,positive
"It's not an exaggeration to say this is literally ""Riverdale"" and ""Chilling Adventures of Sabrina"" story lines that got rearranged & copy and pasted for this show's plot, I know that because I did myself the misfortune of sitting through all these shows. It's a disappointment, with misleading trailers and reviews. It's so grossly over-hyped just for you to realize it's nothing but a lazy cash-grab, and that's why every promotion focused so much attention to the big names rather than the story or content itself. Something that you can unmask about the positive reviews is that none of them are critical or capable of a detailed opinionated review. Their reviews are vague and reason-less because they liked the decent looking actors, the superficial aesthetic, the good but basic indie/overplayed soundtrack, and the slightly Tim Burton atmosphere, but they're unable to pinpoint that because most of these reviewers are likely unaware of it. When it comes to the actual story, no way did anyone like this shallow plot that is no joke, a rip-off of ""Riverdale"" and ""Chilling Adventures of Sabrina"". The protagonist is a cookie cutter ""weird girl"" who always has to remind you every time she opens her mouth that she's ""not like other girls"" which gets old quick but lasts the whole series. No character, not even the protagonist, has growth, depth, character, or culture (which is ironic because of how much Jenna talks in interviews about representing her Latin culture). The dialogue the writers wrote for the protagonist is very clearly what a mindless person would imagine a thinking person sounds like but to anyone sensible she just sounds very pretentious and childishly edgy. While previous depictions of Wednesday made her a smart and funny character (and movies like Addams Family Values gave her growth), this Wednesday is hard to not cringe at. You can tell this was just a paycheck to the creators because they literally thought throughout this series that a one-off act done in the movies was some kind of deeper connection to her history. They took an interesting eccentric family and instead chose to center the story on boring cardboard cutouts of fantasy teen drama extras who are an unsubtle attempt to one-up the eccentrics of the family which obviously misses the entire point of the Addams Family. On the second watch, It really stuck out, how bad the acting is, most of the actors are either under-performing their parts or dramatically performing like Disney channel cartoon characters. In its most basic proposition this show had potential if there were any creative minds involved. The biggest disappointment is the reception, lousy cliche cash grabs like this getting positive support to this extent, just confirms people will eat up anything. If they like the aesthetic, the big names, and the heavily reused soundtrack, regardless of any effort or creativity on their end people will pay a lot more for copy and pasted formulaic media. We're in a never-ending cycle of unoriginal and uninspired remakes, reboots, redesigns, spin-offs, sequels, etc. Because big companies like getting rid of any shred of originality and people support milking out any creativity to the point media becomes this dry. It's frustrating because even the people involved in making this series have publicly admitted to rushing it and inserting the most basic and predictable cliches because of how little this side-project mattered to them.",8,positive,positive

"Disney has apparently given up completely on even trying to produce a decent Star Wars title. The writing is not particularly good, the characters and situations are uninteresting, and the plot is virtually nonexistent. Making it through the first two episodes was agonizing. It's mind-numbingly unimaginative drivel, neatly packaged with a Star Wars logo, so some people will love it regardless of its low quality. The production design is good, and with the exception of one annoying, stuttering Droid, the cast seems competent enough. While I appreciate the idea of a more mature Star Wars show, it would be much nicer to see one that had even a little thought or care put into it's writing.",10,positive,positive
"I am writing this review in anticipation of season 3. After being largely entertained by the previous two seasons.  Unlike many other series and movies (there are so many to choose from). Some are good, some easily forgettable. I keep thinking about this series.  Why is The White Lotus so good? Why would I recommend it to new viewers?  There are three components that make it so good: 1) Unique characters portrayed by excellent actors 2) The combination with the beautiful surroundings and the drama that takes place between the characters. Everything that the beautiful surroundings hide 3) The surprising experiences. The unpredictable and partly shocking events in the series are the opposite of boring and predictable.  The White Lotus manages to entertain, surprise and shock. Everything is so well executed; acting, script, direction and the setting.  The White Lotus deliver at a sky-high level. A lot of other things become downfalls after watching this series. I hope for much more.",8,positive,positive
"I stopped watching this after season 2, as did many of my friends. It seemed like one of these stories that just goes on and on, repeating new but same misery all over again and never reaching a solution. When I found out season 5 had been released I gave it another try and watched from the beginning, mostly because I had nothing else to watch atm. I am so glad I did. Season 1 and 2 has a lot of slow and sometimes exhausting storybuilding in them, which is actually necessary to really comprehend the situation for the characters for the coming seasons. You just have to endure them to really understand the complexity. I am so glad I watched all the existing 5 seasons. This show is a masterpiece on so many levels that I don't even know where to start. Every character is there for a reason, acting is over the top, there's so many stories beautifully entwined into one. It's not an easy thing to watch, and it makes sure you watch every second. I see a lot of complaining about close-ups in the comments, as well as Moss's acting. I can't stop wondering wether this is because Moss isn't picture perfect? Which is one of the things I love the most with this show. It's very raw, sometimes ugly, honest and true. It displays women in a way that we are not used seeing them. Women with different bodies, women controlling their sexuality(when they can, ofcourse), women being angry. I could go on and on. Just wow. Thank you for this. It's not like anything else I have ever seen.",10,positive,positive
"Great fan of the novel as much as of the video game, I confess to being rather disappointed by the series. Despite a good script and quite successful special effects, the series lacks substance. I regret that the irreverent humour present in the original novel/game has completely disappeared to give way to a politically correct narrative. But what bothers me the most is the totally wacky choice of the casting crew regarding the iconic character of Yennefer. Why did they choose an actress devoid of charisma and not particularly pretty (even ugly) to play the sublime witch? With a prognathic chin, a big nose and an almost permanent strabismus, the Yennefer of the series does not reach the ankle of her video game alter-ego. Her soppy interpretation is also not up to the task and really lacks credibility. And that ruins everything!",9,positive,positive
"Reading a few of the negative reviews makes me wonder whether people actually sit down and WATCH shows anymore, or whether they just put them on in the background and only partially pay attention. There seem to be a lot of misconceptions about what's going on in the show, judging from what some of the other (negative) reviews say. Obviously no show is for everyone - I'm just truly wondering if some of these folks weren't really paying attention and therefore missed what was actually happening.  Anyway, I was riveted. I took one star off just to acknowledge that there are a few slight imperfections - but overall this show was fantastic. The acting was stellar all around. I agree with some of the reviewers who said Jennifer Coolidge played her role to perfection (Emmy nomination, anyone?). Her character was so cringey, and the thing is, she was like someone you've met before... someone you'd find incredibly annoying in ways but couldn't bring yourself to all-out dislike.  In fact, all of the characters seemed like people you'd met before - some of whom you'd like more than others. I'm surprised I haven't seen anyone else mention what a fantastic job Natasha Rothwell did as Belinda. She was so believable (such natural acting that it wasn't like watching someone act!), and the frustration she experienced was palpable.  This is definitely not a show for people who need to be spoon-fed a predictable story, and the music is evidently not for everyone, but I certainly found it refreshing (the choir-performed pieces with full harmony were beautiful). The setting was enchanting. I thought the ""yellowish"" cast to the film felt like Hawaii actually feels (having been there more than once).  I also thought the themes of privilege, racism, sexism, classism, sexual preference, and so forth were presented really well. If you watch without your own preconceived ideas, you'll see that no one particular ""side"" is being favored. There are nuanced arguments to be made for each person's experience (yeah, even the super rich, privileged white folks are portrayed with complexity, rather than painted with broad strokes). None of these themes are offered as ""in your face"" neat and tidy summaries. You have to soak up the subtleties to get the layered message that (at least in my opinion) was intended.  I'm excited that there'll be a second season! This is one of the best shows I've watched in a long, long time.",6,neutral,positive
"First of all its such a great landscape. For sure, you have to love cowboys to get through this marvelouse western series. Dark crimes, family, nature and a lot of things going on, at the Dutton Ranch. Kevin Costner is in his perfect role, as a strong family father, who tries to manage his big empire - like dancing with the wolves in modern times. Cowobys and Indians.",7,neutral,positive
"I'm not getting this at all.  I watched the first season, thought it was a bit of fun. Mediocre but fun. I remember thinking - this is something they could build on.  Then the second season was worse!  Not sure about the third.  I heard Spielberg not only liked the second season, but watched it twice!  Guess I'm the fool.  I did like the idea, I guess that's why I felt the first season could be built upon. The exotic seclusion. The chance to be something else or become something else. The journey of that. Some of the stuff with the characters made me think... THIS COULD GO SOMEWHERE!  NOPE.  Maybe I should open my mind to Season 3 and see if I was wrong.",4,negative,positive
The Last of Us series truly is a pinnacle of success and sets a standard for movies or series adapting any games.. Me being a huge fan of the game is so impressed how the cast and crew and of course the director have truly brought this to life. It is truly a feast to the eyes watching this series..as it is said .. on screen technical wizardry. The most impressive thing i find about the series is how they connected it to the real world... because believe it or not.. it may be a possibility the man kind can be perished by such fungus... i think THE LAST OF US deserves all the praises in the world and i am so sure that it will win awards one day as the game did...just amazing.,10,positive,positive
"This is a better show than I orginally thought.  I originally disliked this because the first two episodes wee ""slow."" I should have watched longer. When I watched it again, my objections vanished. The plot is non unusual: protagonist fights evil, and watches out for the pure and the innocent. And so it happens that he comes upon a young girl he is fated to meet, and spends the rest of the time protecting her from those who want her dead.  People have noted that Cavil is the high point which makes sense, given he is the title character. One doesn't see his magical abilities in the beginning episodes , so I would suggest getting past the first two episodes and then watching it more intently. The script is well-written, and the actors have decent acting chops.",10,positive,positive
"The last time I actively kept up with a tv show was back in 2013, when I first got into watching Sherlock. But I've recently discovered this gem of a show and I'm hooked on it! The storyline, the cast, the cinematography -- everything's great! Honourable mention of Cillian Murphy who plays Thomas Shelby so beautifully. I can't imagine anyone else as the enigmatic Tommy; he's fiercely protective of his family, is highly intelligent and despite all his shortcomings and mistakes, the show (which is told in his POV) makes you root for him.  I love this show and it really does live up to its deserved high ratings!",8,positive,positive
"Tim Burton is my absolute favorite. I actually watched this series because he was directing.  What a masterpiece! Loved everything about it. Ortega's performance was unexpected and she plays this character perfectly.  As for the rest of the cast....also very impressed! Maybe there is hope for Netflix after all. I waited very long after the Witcher and did not think I would enjoy anything as much, but I love to be proven wrong.  Creepy, mystery, dark, funny and entertaining all at once. Thank you Tim Burton. Thank you Netflix. And thank you Ortega for this masterpiece.  I can't wait to see what the future holds for Wednesday Addams!",10,positive,positive

"This was the strongest HBO series I've seen and by far the best video game adaptation depicted on television. Episode one felt like a movie; great pacing and cinematic qualities. The special effects, story, and acting are all utterly amazing. I was so impressed with the acting talent of even the child actors, especially Joel's daughter. I am unfamiliar with the video-game but the show's premise is interesting. It strikes me as an I AM Legend remake with even better special effects and story than the original blockbuster. I look forward to seeing how this story unfolds. Some of the scenes were scary and emotional. So far so great.",10,positive,positive

"There's no actual plot. Every single character is at best one-dimensional. Things happen because banal clichés collide, cause shootouts, then leave the scene fundamentally unchanged. Conflicts arise because people are stupid.  The setting feels very genuine and eye candy, so there's that.  Is it better Star Wars than the recent movies? Yes. Is it better entertainment? Also yes. But think about it: this is not saying much, now is it?  This is good only for setting-starved, die hard fans with no reference. Also for door murder fetishists. Otherwise? I've found myself hoping it would end sooner.  (That was the first season. Second, however, makes it completely worth it.)",9,positive,positive
"This is such a great series, and I am loving that everything about the Reacher Actor is exactly how I know him in the books right down to the Black Coffee, Toothbrush and his physique! Not skinny and short like some other actor. (Tom) This is very well made, and if you understand the books, you will be happy.  All I can hope for is that after this series, they continue with another story from the books.  This must continue for all the Books!!!!!!  Love it!",6,neutral,positive
"I really loved the first few seasons but this last season is nothing more than a soap opera. Just like a soap opera, characters are constantly crying, getting angry, getting hurt, and being put into the same situations over and over. They are in the hospital, having secret encounters with old lovers, making the same plans and their world is ending but always in a slightly different way. Yet their world doesn't end and they find themselves is the same situation. No one learns lessons or makes better decisions. Everything is just recycled. It's old and exhausting. If you miss soap operas, this show is for you!",10,positive,positive
"Pretty crummy overal, there were so many moments of bad acting, terrible cgi or practical effects (the hostage scene with the elves) that it was extremely difficult to take seriously.

Hope the next season can embrace a slightly more serious tone with a higher budget and better post production.",10,positive,positive

"Season 1 is way better than season 2, season 1 had Connie Britton and Alexandria, Daddario in it, the manager was hilarious despite the annoying Australian accent he played the character so well as anyone that works with people has felt like he has. Jennifer Coolidge never disappoints and is in season 1 and 2. Much better storyline and a lot funnier especially the poo in the suitcase. Season 2 was boring I usually love Aubrey but she always plays Aubrey barely smiles and looks similar to Connie's daughter is season 1.  The Italian escort is stunning but how can the father be so stupid to not check what these girls are spending and why isn't management telling him?  The grandfather is hilarious, the son naive, the rich couple living in a bubble are enjoying but it's reality.  The scenery was much better Italy is incredible it's just a shame that the storyline was nowhere near as good.  My advice is watch season one first.",8,positive,positive
"I've played the games, i played The witcher once, Assassins and Kings twice, and the wild hunt i've played for 600 hours. so you can call me a fan of the series. i've not read the books but i was prepared that it was not gonna be exactly like the games.  Me and my dad are big fantasy genre fans, but my father has never heard of the witcher. since I am a fan of the witcher i almost forced him to watch the witcher. i did some minor explaining beforehand to make him somewhat familiar with the witcher universe. For me, watching this was easy. i knew who and what the characters are and what they represent. My dad, not so much, he found it slighlty difficult. I could go on and on, but i wont.  He's a fan of the Witcher Universe and Geralt now too.  Well done netflix, not all beloved book/game TV adaptasjon are as good as this to put it mildly, but you made me happy (and my dad).",6,neutral,positive
"To be honest, like everyone else, I decided to start the series when I saw Grogu. When it comes to the flow of the story, the quality of the effects and other things, it's like watching a long-running film. The effects are so good that they really need to be exaggerated a bit more. I started the series after Boba Fett and we see that it is much higher in most aspects. If we analyse the series in general, there are only a few points where the quality is poor, but they are necessary for the flow of the story. Let's come to the main topic, the Mandolorians are not a community known by those who are not much in the universe like me, and when you see that the Mandolorians and the Jedi story are so special, you get hooked. Grogu steals our hearts right from the start with his cuteness. I couldn't do it very well, but I think it should be finished carefully, without rushing.",8,positive,positive
Yes... I know... it's not about the Adam's Family and I didnt expect it to be. It IS called Wednesday after all. But that doesn't excuse it from lacking that charm that made the movies so iconic. This really doesn't have much charm at all. I was REALLY looking forward to this as I LOVE all the Adam's family movies.... but I'm on Episode 4 and I am STRUGGLING to keep watching. It's a bit soapy for my tastes. There is very little comedy or anything worth a chuckle. The movie's were full of that. The higher production quality is keeping it above a CW series but just BARELY. And that makes me sad. I don't really understand how this has an 8.5 currently.... 3/10 is the best I can do and that is very generous. The essence of every character in this has been changed in including Wednesday. And what did they do to Puggsly? He is a cry baby wimp now. The more I reflect on what I have seen... the more I dislike it. I was going to finish watching it. But I think I am done with it. The only character true to the essence is.... Thing.

I did Like this show for concept they have in the series and dark elements as well. But after many many people saying this best series ever for months after the release got to be really annoying and unnecessary. All I see on social media is polls saying chose Wednesday or Harry Potter or strangers things or something else and put a certain emoji as their vote. Of course Wednesday would be the favorite all the time for months. This started pissing me and others off. Like I bet the only reason people like this show because of The Adam family and Jenna Ortega. Not many people knew who jenna Ortega till the show was released. Y'all like her because of the show and y'all didn't know her until 2022 the year of becoming more popular and that ain't right y'all are just using her as something that is better than lots of celebrities yall like her because of her portrayal of Wednesday. Keep that in mind.,10,positive,positive

"I grew up watching the original series and the movies in the 90s so I have a very clear image of who the Adams Family are or should be and this series really captured those characters well. The episodes were nicely filmed, contained lots of drama, suspense, and some more and less expected plot twists. The costumes, aesthetic, and atmosphere were well captured. Jenna Ortega becomes her own Wednesday, at times relatable, and at times just totally what you'd expect from Wednesday. Thing was - hands down - the most fun character. I hope there will be more seasons that will bring more of the characters we love (like cousin Itt), and some more of that tim-burton-esque aesthetic, which is probably why most of us were so curious (or at least I was...).",10,positive,positive
"I love the early 20th century felling of the first two deries and the mid 20th in the third, the mix of great storyline combined with the spectacular acting and actors just hits my sweetspot right in the middle",10,positive,positive
"We just finished season 2 (wawoooooo !).., and thus is definitely one of the best series ever!  A mm amazing script, wonderful characters that we fall in love with all of the Shelby and spouses, perfect directing, music, all technical aspects.  And so touching... really, tears every ten minutes....  Same level as Chernobil and breaking bad.  Second only to the best series ever (Sherlock).",8,positive,positive
"Beware of religions. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. All those bigots would have a word like this one if we'd let them have their way.  A great piece of human story: Past, present and future.",9,positive,positive
"My first review here, i simply love this show! I've seen hundreds of tv shows/movies but his one its so touching!",6,neutral,positive
"This is the best series I've ever watched, it's been brutal, beautiful and emotional. It's true to the cattle ranches, the cowboys, the plight of the native Indians and to the land.  It questions humanity and morality.  I've been swept away by its honesty and fell in love with some of its characters, I had to brace myself and prepare myself for the last episode because this sort of brilliance doesn't happen that often. I'm in awe of everyone involved and look forward to anything that follows...Kelly Reilly... I tip my hat to you, you have outshone any actress playing any character in any film and that includes Scarlett O'Hara.  Thank y'all x.",10,positive,positive
"Having read many Reacher novels, and watching the two Reacher movies. I have to say, this is what Lee Child envisioned when he created Reacher. If you enjoy the Tom Cruise movies , you should, enjoy them as Tom Cruise movies, because that's what they are, if you are a Reacher book fan, this is a show for you. Not disappointed. I hope they make many more books with Alan Ritchson.",10,positive,positive
"My family absolutely LOVE the Addams Family. However i'm not as big a fan as them, but i absolutely loved this show.  Jenna Ortega was 100% the best person for this, every role she plays is perfect.  Tim did an amazing job with everything: the costumes, the camera work, the characters depth and improvement, the plot twists everything is on point.  And the fact that the original Wednesday Addams is in the movie (the redhead normie teacher) makes it even better.  The fact that Wednesday never blinked in the entire show is amazing acting, Jenna really outdid herself with this.  Even the side characters have you gripped into the story.",9,positive,positive

Great first seasone. I am ready to next one. Fantastic actresses.,9,positive,positive
"This show is highly recommended for women and real important for men. Women go through phases which only they can understand. Childbirth is one the primes among all. Things they cannot express, have been properly explained in such a soothing way. Kudos, to the creators!",10,positive,positive
"The production values on this series is off the roof (they even used anamorphic lenses and an Alexa LF, the highest one can get today budget-wise). Very classical Star Wars-looking and feeling, I think the older fans will be happy with this series.  My only complain is that the editing was way too fast. The actual live action only was 37 minutes! Usually, pilots on non-network TVs are anywhere between 55 and 70 minutes, to create the new world, capture it, and hook us in. The Mandalorian instead was hop-hop-hop, from one place to another, without much time to enjoy the various planets/places. The establishing shots simply weren't there, and that hurt the atmosphere of the show.  Overall though, not bad, it's a cowboy fantasy sci-fi.",10,positive,positive
"Sorry to all fans of this, but it quite disappointed me. I prefer the low cost old polish version Wiedzmin and books. This is just Netflix ordinary fantasy adaption, which is ruined in many ways for me. I only continued watching because of Henry Cavill, he did a good job.",10,positive,positive
"My favourite tv show. Their is something about peaky blinders that makes u want more and more after each episode. Your on the edge of your seats, every line leads to something critical. Tommy Shelby played by the great Cillian Murphy is excellent and perfect, a role he was born to play. Worth a watch you'll enjoy every second of this amazing show.",10,positive,positive
"It is one of the serials that are started without expectations, to fill free time, but watched and finished in a single breath.  It both took us back to our childhood and ended the season leaving a good taste in our mouths.  And the tim burton signature already makes it one click ahead of other series.  The series is a classic Tim Burton piece. It has become a watchable series with a cool character network that does not tire the subject, which is enjoyable to watch. Of course, there will be those who criticize, but the fact that even a garbage producer like Netflix could not spoil it shows how high quality the story is. I liked the lead character very much, I don't know if I internalized it because I found inspirations from myself, but the story drew me in a lot. I hope it continues.",7,neutral,positive
"I've watched many, many series and films. But nothing has ever fascinated me as much as Yellowstone. Each character has their own deep story to tell. The plot ranges from suspense to action and occasionally evokes sad emotions. And if that's not enough: the cast is Oscar-worthy. Kevin Costner is in his prime! Anyone who hasn't seen this series has an absolute lack of education! Added to this is the insane soundtrack. I only noticed through Yellowstone that Kevin Costner sings. And yes, maybe I've discovered a new favorite genre as a result. I'm from Germany and whenever I see the cowboys working in this beautiful nature I get wanderlust and envy!",10,positive,positive
"Season 1 great, 2 good, 3 gave up.  Season 1 was very good. Book of Boba, Andor etc are garbage. Stuck with this one, season 2 was good but gave up after a few episodes of season 3. Too much poor cgi, boring storyline and just dull. Yet another Star Wars series that tries to get as many weird robots or aliens in as it can. Why not just use the ones from the first 3 films and a few new ones that are played by people, not done as obvious cgi. They are poorly done and do nothing for the series. Just stick to a few series or characters rather than keep churning out this rubbish. The 'new' films are just as bad.",10,positive,positive
"Bad CGI, mediocre acting. Mediocre in every way. The next GoT this is not...",7,neutral,positive
