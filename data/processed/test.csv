"Peaky Blinders is a highly underrated series. Cillian Murphy plays Tommy Shelby, the most complex, nuanced character I've ever seen in a tv series. He's head of a gangster family in post-WW1 Birmingham, England. He's surrounded by great performances: Paul Anderson as his brother Arthur, Helen McCrory as his sister Polly, and Thomas Hardy as Alfie (can't get enough of Alfie) to name a few. Great characters, thoughtfully written, compelling storylines, and beautiful cinematography. Great, eclectic soundtrack too (Bowie, Nick Cave, PJ Harvey & Radiohead).",10,positive
"Don't gudg the show from the first season, wait for it until the second season begins.  You will regret if you don't see this show.......  Enjoy the rest.",9,positive
"Absolutely in dismay. Once again, some hollywood executive absolutely destroys something good by refusing to pay the lead actor as their salary expectations rise in line with the popularity of the series. HOW WRONG CAN YOU GET IT ??? How on earth can anyone watch this series and not get that Cavill makes it happen. What an insane and absurd decision. I hope that season three falls to the bottom pits of hell and is forgotten in the mists of time. BRING BACK CAVILL FOR SEASON FOUR you bloated hollywood big wigs. He is the witcher, there will never be another. Fans of fantasy of the world, rise up and be heard.",2,negative
"Seriously, that is a hell of a lot of animal feed. I wish people would listen to me more about animal feed. I mean, why that much animal feed is beyond me. Seriously though this Jack Reacher is a good time and there is a ton of animal feed in the show.",5,neutral
"As fan of the games, the show it's ok. If you haven't played the games you probably would like it but it almost identical to the game (even word to word dialogues) with same changes that don't make sense (the changes create plot holes, change character race for just fun makes no sense when there is an established source material that came out 2013). Why would I see a show that I already have seen (played) makes no sense. Probably gonna be a big hit cause most people will say it's good if that's what they are told. Feels like another cash grab for 3 to 5 years with an ending that people will hate (it's kinda standard that most shows don't know how to end. People saying it's a bad ending cause what they wanted didn't happen). The performances weren't something special even from the big stars.",8,positive
Thomas Shelby makes smoking look healthy. Cilian Murphy nailed the character.,2,negative
"A watered-down version of the books, gaps in each episode that feels rushed. Don't get me wrong, the acting is excellent and Henry portraying of Geralt of Rivia come from someone who knows the character, but the plot should be improved in season two (that would be the Blood of Elves).",6,neutral
"Love the show. I am not a big fan of Kevin Costner but do enjoy his performance as the patriarch John Dutton. It has fantastic storylines, not all believable but makes for great viewing. I really love Cole Hauser's character Rip Wheeler and Luke Grimes' Kayce Dutton are the highlights for me. If i have one gripe it would be the bitchinees and nastyness from Beth Dutton, played fantastically by Kelly Reilly, seems a little over the top.",10,positive
"This series is the best, especially for this era, it's one of my favorite times in history. The actors, the plot, the actions of all the characters, is all a 10 plus!!! I would be on edge and I was always shocked on how episodes would end and especially each season!! I have become a huge fan of actors I didn't know much about or actors I had never seen before! Now, I'm hooked on all of their movies and series! I'm looking forward to watching more of these great actors. This series is phenomenal! I cannot wait for sequel/prequel!! I've read it will happen soon and I cannot wait! I prefer series over movies but whichever comes out I'm definitely going to be watching!",10,positive
"After my high hopes for Episodes 7 , 8 and 9 were shattered by poor story telling and a clear misunderstanding of Episode 4 , 5 and 6 , it's great to see a creative team actually produce something that for me .... is Star Wars Apart from Gareth Edwards , Rogue One nothing has reached the heights of TESB !! But john Favreau and his team are hot on his heels with The Mandelorian The whole feel to the action , how it's filmed and looks on screen hits the Mark No Lame humour or awful acting Original stories without feeling it was wrote on the day of shooting 10/10 and any new Star Wars productions should be made to this level .... or don't bother",10,positive
"This is an utter masterpiece! Finally someone got social commentary right. The thing that makes genius is it gives you so many perspectives, not just an uber woke point of view. You really feel like you understand these people even if you don't like them or identify with their issues ... so refreshing because everything seems to be one sided these days.  BRAVO!",9,positive
"The show goes through its plot and character work at such a quick speed that the weight of a lot of moments don't feel as heavy as they should or could. It's also structured very strangely for seemingly no reason and the strange editing choices don't help in any way. Although I will say it's still worth a watch for the fantastic fantasy elements on display. From the monsters to the magic and the epic battles. It delivers. Does it come close to game of thrones? In terms of fantasy entertainment? I can't say. They're both extremely different. In terms of effects and action scenes. It definitely comes close. In terms of characters, emotions, and intrigue. Nowhere near.",10,positive
"To be honest I never felt so weird while watching this... but in a good way. Not everyone will enjoy The White Lotus (yeah Im that guy who says this).  The series does not have big action sequences or effects, instead,it focuses on the people and their relationships-family , marriage, friendship, love. Every character is complex and unique, has needs and especially NEGATIVE traits. We follow these people as they spend a week in an exotic hotel and interact with each other and the place . Without spoiling , the series has a strong build up in tension and suspense which ends up in the climaxing 6th episode where everything is resolved.  The acting is award-tier(I loved Armond played by Murray Bartlett) and the score is also fitting and amazing. Solid 9/10 thanks HBO for providing top quality content again.",7,neutral
"Wednesday is like an outcast Nancy Drew with a touch of darkness and a bit of ""Stranger Things"" thrown in.  Wednesday is one of those rare shows that took me by surprise in an extremely good way. It (Wednesday) kept me intrigued and glued from the first episode to the last. It was hands down, the only TV show that I've binged watched this year. It's that captivating.  The show while hardly original, is refreshing and unique from its point of view - a teenage Wednesday. The cast were well chosen (apart from IMO, Luis Guzman as Gomez Addams - Don't get me wrong, Luis is a great actor and I'm a fan, but as the suave and charming Gomez, Luis is not). Jenna Ortega did a superb job portraying the protagonist ""Wednesday"". Her acting is sublime. The other actors in the show did equally a brilliant job - kudos to the director (Tim Burton). And that dance. Yeah, the dance. You can't miss that part. I read Jenna choreographed it herself.  Apart from the magnificent acting, the sets and directing were first rate. Tim Burton knocked another one out of the park. But I'm sure, it was made easy with Jenna Ortega in the main lead. Her take on Wednesday, took the character to a whole new level. She made Wednesday her own. Love it.  VERDICT: Don't miss it. A must watch.",3,negative
"Favreau and co. seem to put forth the most competent Star Wars effort by Disney thus far. While I enjoyed Rogue One and I don't hate nor do I love the flagship Disney sequels VII and VIII, this will likely be their adaptation I enjoy most. I'll be back with my reasons why at the end of the season so we shall see.",4,negative
"The only problem with this series is that my husband's howling laughter is going to impair my hearing.  Apart from that, I love the script, the social critique, the eerie, suffocating shots of waves, the ironic POV on the ""scenic"" elements and kitsch Hawaiiana, the perspective on class, race and colonialism, and the mix of slapstick and subtle nuance in the acting.  And the music! I could just put the introduction on repeat.  Only reason I gave it 9 out of 10 is that we haven't seen the final episode yet.",8,positive
"Loved season 1 and highly recommended it.  Season 2-3 is OK too but season 4 is so unrealistic.  Season 4 felt like the they had to tell a storyline without any thought about reality.  I mean it is very difficult to cross boarders bit suddenly its so easy, it seems like everyone can cross and do whatever they want... There are so many situation through season 4 which seem very unrealistic, actions no nobody would do, like 'oh something looks very wrong but I don't care I will just walk in there through the front not even try sneak in...",10,positive
"I haven't played the video game, but if episode 1 is any indication, this series will have a highly successful run.  The opening credit is so creative. It shows how the fungus grows and spreads. I can't help but be reminded of the COVID 19 virus as it mutates and spreads. The film genre has mutated. It used to be lorded over by all kinds of zombie stories. Great ones, to be sure, like World War Z, Walking Dead, Black Summer and even Korean films like Train to Busan and Kingdom. Now, we have a deadly fungal infection whose effects on the individual are very similar to those on people who become zombies.  The episode is unsettling as well as thought-provoking. The musical score suitably adds to the gloomy and foreboding tone.  It's a reunion of Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey who starred both in the hit series ""Game of Thrones.""  It's early days yet. We'll know if it will turn out to be a monster hit.",9,positive
"I sat on a comfortable chair, took a cup of tea, and sat watching the Sun go down on Star Wars. The night felt lonely and long. Yet there is a new day again. The sun rises even more brighter this time, bringing life, bringing joy!  For the first time, i look forward to see the end of an episode, with amazing still graphics, and the soulful music by Ludwig. A must watch for every Star Wars fan.  I have spoken!",3,negative
"I'm sorry but I don't understand all the hate here. I binge watched this whole thing in a couple of days. It's not game of thrones and I think that's people expected? Not sure, I know I'm not the best review guy, but I do know good shows and movies, this is solid. I've only binge watched a few different shows, stranger things, game of thrones and the witcher. A+ for making me play the next episode...episode after episode",7,neutral

"2 episodes in, really wanted to like this. Production and budget seems high but casting and acting is awful. Henry Cavill as Geralt is actually really good but everyone else is pathetic. There is a reason why GoT cast is almost only brits, this is laughable. Such a waste.",10,positive
Henry caville was great as Geralt but once again Netflix have proven they have done a disaster I loved the first episode but after that was over I expected more action and I was frankly very bored it failed to hold my attention. Just a shame because I had high hopes for it as an avid lover of the games,8,positive
"They should have ended the show at the end of the last season. It is so boring. The cast are dull, two-dimensional, uninteresting and even the recurring people are now flat. Enough already with the hedonism. It is like a never ending bad American Spring break party, full of drunks, nudity and drugs.  I can see this going on and on for several more series. But why? It has none of intrigue or humour of the earlier work.  Perhaps this was just a blip and they will actually hire actors and give them a real scrip. There is nothing redeeming about this season.  Having read other reviews I still find it difficult to comprehend the appeal. It is just depressingly bad. What possessed the writer to ruin such a historic and interesting country with sad Americans?",9,positive
"Remember how amongst the lightweight drivel, uninventive fan-servicing, and confused plotting/character arcs of the last batch of Star Wars films Rogue One shone like a beacon of decent filmmaking? Well three episodes in and it looks like Andor is doing exactly the same thing for the Star Wars TV series. Unburdened by the need to placate nostalgic adult-kids that grew up with the original films (or even the poor souls that grew up with the prequel trilogy and so have a nostalgic fondness for those), or the need to pass under the scrutinous eye of the studious geeks who ""know"" how the Force and hyperdrives work (as though they're real things) - Andor is free to 'simply' build interesting characters, plots, storylines and visuals to give us the dramatic framework for what is shaping up to be just a damn good story and adventure.  Sadly, like Rogue One, it also stands - by example - as a reminder of what could have been. Of what a terrible wasted opportunity the rest of this latest run of Star Wars output has been (with just the occasional, infuriating glimmer of quality thinly veined through Obi-Wan and The Mandalorian).  Here's hoping the rest of this series manages to capitalise on this great start, and leaves us with at least one more properly good piece of work in this third age of Star Wars.",6,neutral

"I absolutely refuse to accept that this is an 8/10. It just isn't. At the very best it's a 5, because I get that it can be popular with 12-16 year olds. But for me it's a solid 1. Something is definitely off about these reviews.  I can't believe it's 2022 and we're still producing cringe content like this. The story is terrible - every common trope you can think of in a teen series - it has it. The entire theme of the school is a ripoff of Hogwarts. There's no real development with the characters & they lack any depth. It feels like some Disney Original series with how surface level the story is and how overdone the characters are and how corny their lines are. I seriously cannot see anyone over the age of 13 giving this garbage more than 4 stars. It isn't a good show, it just isn't.",9,positive
"Alan Ritchson was good in the Titans, but this is the role he was born to play. Great cast all around. A couple of small plot holes, but nothing too major and all in all a good start to the series. Can't wait for the next installment!",10,positive
"I really love this series so much that I really can't stop watching the episodes. But there is one very big problem in this series, and that problem is the character (Beth Dutton). The personality is very bad in all aspects. Firstly, the character's relationship with her father makes me sick. It is a very bad relationship. There is no relationship like this relationship in the world. She does not respect him at all, but at the same time she loves him and does what he wants. The bad thing about this character is that she does what she wants and no one can stop her. The way she speaks and acts makes you wonder how this great writer and director could come up with this extremely bad character. I have seen many bad characters in my life, but this character is something completely different from the rest of the characters.",10,positive
"I have watched this show over the course of I guess 3-4 years now. Watched the prequels and about to watch the final season of the newest one. Rewatched some of the first seasons to prepare for the final season. And personally, I'm just mad. Being a conservative I hate how it ended. Flat out hate it. How did they not figure out how to keep the ranch and let rip run it? What's the deal with Casey? Like I said it's been over years watching maybe I forget. The Beth character is an odd one. I vaguely remember Jamie's decision to take her to the clinic but I guess she was broken before that and that sealed her. She essentially ruined the legacy. Rip was the best character and the real true son John needed but never noticed. It ends with each going their own way. And the natives getting the land back and tearing it all down. Folks there's a thing called spoils of war. Going on since the dawn of man. It's just bizarre how Sheridan and crew played it out. Shows good/very great but to have it all end without an actual way to save it and make money (u know like selling beef and 1/2 cows to people) is laughable really. I live in Missouri and farmers of cattle have adapted literally like the 4 sixes. What about Loyd? He lived there for 40 plus years. He damn near owns it. His payout was a couple grand? Good god Sheridan that's all you get for retirement?",10,positive
"The strong character of Wednesday Adams is what made me stick to the series.  The scenes of Wednesday playing cello and her dance are the two scenes that i play again and again.  I mean these two scenes specifically are perfect for me.  The dark theme, strong sounds n song, and powerful character.  Its hard to find such strong dark themed series which doesn't go haywire midway.  They kept the character strong, dark, straight rude and did not turn her into evil. It was so great to watch it.  As a whole, it's really watchworthy and i really expect more seasons as I want to see more of Wednesday Adams.",3,negative
"Perfect first season, solid 9. It was a beautiful disaster! Second and third seasons were very good as well. Solid 8.  Overall wonderful script across all seasons, well casted actors, great cinematography.  4th season kept most of the good elements but lacked pace. It was painfully dragged. Repetitive shots, exaggerated beauty shots, repetitive lines, it could be summed up in 3 episodes, and it would still be slow paced. The craziness was there but very diluted.  I know people are lacking attention span and I'm not excluded from the symptom for sure but, man, going round and round just feels frustrating. If it weren't for that I'd give this 4th season a solid 7, but I'll have to settle for a 6.  Still one of the best shows of the 2020's so far.",3,negative
"This is like watching a train wreck in slow motion. Amazing. It took two episodes to really start rolling but by the third, the guests were starting to unravel. For those who love quirky satire, and has elements of english farce.",8,positive
"I could say, The Last of Us TV adaptation deserved a hats off for doing what we deserved to watch. Hope it stays that way, not how the Game of Thrones ruined us, or should I say, ruined their reputation.  I just saw it a year ago when this video game will turn into a full TV series, and I just reacted that was Ow! The Walking Dead (Hey, Rick Grimes!), you better get off your way cause TLOU is coming.  I didn't expect how the series began and how the post apocalyptic started in its first episodes. That's how you do it, bro! I think the point here is kind of interesting. No more speculations, no more questoning what was the cause for all of this!  The Last of Us is killing it! Best of luck... I'm a superfan now, by the way.",10,positive
"So, I'm all caught up after my son told me that I should watch it. I'm glad he did, but, I'm a little pissed too. It's really tough to simply turn the show off and get to bed. Suffice to say, I haven't had much sleep lately and that might show in my writing.  Yellowstone is a little like GOT in that the bad guy becomes the good guy and then a bad guy later. I like dramas that blur the line between good and bad, it's much more human and more relevant to the human condition. Voldemort nailed it, ""There's no good or evil, only power and those too afraid to seek it."" That sums up this series.  While, for the most part, the performances are brilliant, I do have issue with how the female characters are portrayed. They become too predictable. Each female character has some psychosis that makes them incapable of rational behavior. While I enjoy the nuisances, and poking fun at women, this show takes it a bit too far as there are really no women who you care to idolize. They come close to creating a character in Beth Dutton, who, at times demonstrates capabilities that I admire, but, then the crazy comes out and undermines it all. This seems to be a common theme in the show and if you see a woman, just know, she's going to be crazy too.  My other complaint are the constant dramatic soliloquies in a slow western drawl. These attempt to be insightful and profound, but, instead of teaching a lesson, these snap us from the realities of their world to that fact that this is only a TV drama and I'm watching actors in a TV show.  Reading some of the other reviews made me giggle. I understand that personal politics influences how you see the world, I do, but, if you let yourself get into the series, you can begin to identify with the differences in culture between urban and rural life. The series demonstrates a conflict between Native American and American values. I don't see that conflict as preachy. One reviewer mentioned that he felt the series was too ""woke"" because the Native Americans expressed that, ""one man should not own this much land."" That sentiment was re-expressed by a Chinese tourist as well. But, in both cases, the show allowed you to feel the conflict between how each culture perceives this and how land ownership is something we value in the USA. In the end, I found myself feeling annoyed at the objections against land ownership.  Politics do take part in the show and I appreciate the perspectives and the conflicts that it portrays. It doesn't seem like the show takes sides, instead, the characters take sides and it's up to the viewer to understand the conflict and create there own alliances. I think it's this that most people don't like. Graying the lines between black and white makes people feel ""icky"" and they don't want to understand the others perspective. It's too much work.",9,positive

"Disney absolutely blew it with the Skywalker saga. Thankfully, their side stories have been mostly solid. Without spoiling anything, I will say this show does a fantastic job of telling its own story while providing plenty of fan service (and I mean good fan service) and remaining true to the real Star Wars Universe. Absolutely love the show and cannot wait for more. Kathleen Kennedy, Ryan Johnson, and JJ Abrams better start taking notes.",4,negative
"I went into this with pretty low expectations, with Tim Burton's name prominently featured and the premise ripe for YA nonsense. But you have to give create where credit is due, Jenny Ortega pretty much single-handedly elevated what would have otherwise been another fate-winx saga and/or cursed or other esc. Show into something better. I mean the writing isn't really much better than those sort of shows but the acting is what makes it enjoyable, esp the main character. Worth a watch if you are into mild horror/goth stuff. Hope netflix makes a note of this when casting and/or making future shows.",10,positive
"I was reluctant to watch this show because, well, zombies, again! It's been done over and over.  I also didn't like Bella Ramsey at all. I'm glad I gave it a chance.  The last of us is a show about human relationships and there are so many beautiful and touching moments. I cared so much about the characters. Even those we only met for one episode.  Bella Ramsey is a great actress. Her portrayal of Ellie and her relationship with Joel is beautiful. You Watch it unfold and develop until its satisfying conclusion.  I'm very much looking forward to season 2.  Started strong and ended with me wanting more.",7,neutral
"I've read some Reacher books. The first film proved that the books provide good material to make a movie. However, the material is not a no-brainer. The second movie was of much lesser quality.  The first season of Reacher was a pleasant surprise. Alan Ritchson carried the series with ease. His Reacher was exactly the right balance between bone-crunching strength and above average brains.  The second season confirmed any preconceived ideas one might have about oversized muscle types like Ritchson. The storyline is predictable, the dialogue ham-fisted and the fights monotonous.  Not sure why this happened but somewhere along the way the producers must have lost some important talent.  I'll watch the third season just to make sure, hoping it can recapture some of the qulity of the first season. Keeping my fingers crossed.",9,positive
"Very well done, nice sense of scale and aesthetics, the tone is right, beautiful scenery and nice acting... This is how Star Wars should be handled.  I Hope we could see more like this in the future... Disney have some problems with storylines from old characters but the news stories like mandalorian they nailed it... Please make this tone for the rest of the franchise. Star Wars should be a grown-up thing like most of the fans that grow up with. Stop wasting our time with current political agenda and give us timeless stories we can remember like the first movies from George Lucas. Thanks you Disney for let this happen.",6,neutral
"An American black comedy drama, it follows the guests and employees of the fictional White Lotus resort chain, whose interactions are affected by their various psychosocial dysfunctions, class conflicts and relationship challenges.  It also hightlights the dilemma of America's upper class - whether to just make lots of money and lead a materialistic, sensual superficial life - or to rather engage in more altruistic pursuits, such as helping People and being part of the NGO Community, to manifest World Peace.  As alluded to in this darma, our advice to all Americans is rather to pursue the former - just make lots of money and be happy :)  The same applies to young aspiring American journalists and intelligent ladies - who are undecided whether to become sexy trophy wives, or boring unsexy NGO activists.  As indicated in this series, being a rich trophy wife is much better - you can have fun and sun all day at a luxury resort, like the Whie Lotus, for example.  You might have to get some plastic surgery though; to keep yourself pretty and interesting to your spouse :)  Indeed, as current Leader of the Global Commuity, I can confirm that NGO stuff and helping People is just very boring and unsexy work.  I'm sure that my crack team at the Pentagon, Guardian, the Sun, France 24, WION and CNN will confirm that.

"Star Wars has always been hit or miss, regardless of what people say about the movies that came out when they grew up. The originals? They were great because they were fun. Andor? It's great because it's dramatic. Star Wars: Andor is a show that explores the dark themes of revolution that Luke or the Jedi never were exposed to, and that we've never seen on screen. The characters are some of the most complex of characters I've ever seen in Star Wars. From the unspeakably excellent writing, I. E. the character Luthen's speech in season one, which anyone who knows it will tell you the same, it's a marvel of story telling, to the cinematography; I. E. the parallels to the French revolution in season two as the rebels work under the shroud of darkness, risking their lives for their cause. The beating heart of Andor lies in the emotion you feel by sympathizing with the characters like Cassian, Bix, Luthen, Clea, Mon, and even the opposing empire characters like Dedra and Syril. Culminating in a story where everyone is on edge, including you. Andor is not like the other Star Wars media, it's bitter and brooding, just like the revolution.",4,negative
"I've played the game and I'm a big fan of it. The game itself is a great story and was very excited for this. They got a lot of the small details from the game in there right. They did their own twist to the story but it's done very well capturing the emotions. Super nice job. Gave the audience a good back story to everything and gave Sarah a good story to add to her character. Gave you some good camera angles just like in the game. Like the casting too, different and they did a good job. Overall well done, if you've never played the game you're in for a good story because it looks like they're going to do the story justice. Super excited for the next episodes. Very promising already.",6,neutral
"Sure, referencing The Godfather leaves this show with big boots to fill, but it is actually a very relevant analogy.  But first, let me interject this:  References to ""Dallas"" and other crappy soap-like shows, that others in here make, are way off base. This show is not that, at all. If you want a reference in terms of the feel of the show, think ""Banshee"" with a much bigger budget... if you want a reference in terms of production quality, we are right up there with the best shows on TV.  Also, this show does not have any political connotations, calling it ""woke"" or ""anti-woke"" like some do - is absurd - it's neither, it's just a good show, irrespective of your political beliefs (which should not factor into what a ""good show"" is anyway).  That rant over - back to the Godfather analogy:  Set in rural modern day Montana, the show is centered around a horse and cattle ranch owner and patriarch, played by Kevin Costner... the ""Vito Corleone"" of the show, if you will... and yes, Costner is still a stellar actor, especially in a rural setting.  Luke Grimes playing the youngest son, is the Michael Corleone of the show, just as split between two worlds, and just as ruthless when he needs to be.... and he plays the role with such conviction, that you completely forget he is an actor.  Cole Hauser plays the adopted son of the house, an amalgamation of Sonny Corleone and Tom Hagen, and plays the role with such ferocity, that he is just about the coolest, hardest modern day cowboy - ever - on TV.  Wes Bentley plays our version of Fredo Corleone, constantly balancing on a knifes edge, being split between loyalty to the family and his own ambition.  Kelsey Asbille plays a breakthrough role, as the native American version of Kay Adams, constantly split between her love for the youngest son of the house, and her hatred of the family, that historically cheated hers out of land.  Last, but most definitely not least, Kelly Reilly is our version of Connie Corleone... but smarter, tougher and much more ambitious... I view her role in this as a career maker... she is just fantastic in this show.  It all takes place in beautiful big sky country, lots of horses, lots of cowboy work, lot's of gun fights and explosions, that are all choreographed with such quality, that every action sequence in the show seems real, while never feeling out of place.  I cannot think of a single thing, that brings this show down, and now in the middle of season 3, it is still the show I look forward to the most.  So I highly recommend the show, but you need to watch the first full season to get into it, like most really good shows, it starts off at a slow burn, to set up the characters and the plot... but don't worry, you WILL be entertained.",10,positive
"I read the book some years ago and despite remembering the entire story I still couldn't stop watching this series. If you haven't read the books this series still stands on its own offering lots of action with an almost super-powered hero who has chosen to help those who have been wronged by fighting the bad guys. Plus, Reacher is hot. Will be waiting for season 2.",6,neutral
"I'm 'older'-and often can't wrap my head around some sci-fi shows.  This one was magnificent-pulling you in from the very first scene where the Fungus Specialists are speaking.  (Interestingly- our entire global eco system is based on fungus.)  It had drama, tension-some really poignant moments- and left me looking forward to the next episode with a passion not felt since the Game of Thrones.  Not that it's a similar story-but it's captured my imagination fully.  After The Banshee of Inisherin- I was bit cautious as the hype encouraged me to watch a ghastly film.  This series cannot be hyped enough to do it justice, in my opinion.  The cast-the scenes- the cohesive story with glimpses/suggestions of classic sci-fi books I read years ago.  The music codes- looking forward to hearing more of them.  I'd give it 20 stars if I could.",9,positive
"This isn't a show where people who've read the book are likely to be irritated very much by differences in the production. There are a lot of similarities, but additional content that fits in very well. The book is really pretty brief, so there is a lot of potential material that could be filled in, and the creators of the series are doing that, superbly, in my opinion. Some elements of the book are absent, most notably the white supremacy aspect of the imagined Republic of Gilead (there are several good articles out there explaining why), but overall, the show aligns closely to the book. The idea of a future where government is a theocratic nightmare, for everyone but upper class men, is certainly plausible, given the examples of religious extremism we see in current life. It's no stretch at all to imagine that there is a contingent of extremist Judeo-Christian males, right here in the USA, who'd love to turn the clock back a few hundred years to the days when White Men Ruled The Earth, so to speak. The Republic of Gilead is a Christian version of the Islamic State, though the structure seems to be all based on Old Testament stories & rules. The show illustrates the horrors of what could happen if the separation of Church and State did not exist in America. It's certainly a wake up call for anyone who thinks it couldn't happen here; the explanation of how Gilead came about provides a very plausible progression of events that might be used to effect such a change in government. The creators of the show have done a great job with casting; the actors are fantastic. I've watched all the available episodes, and I can't wait for the next round. Next season will begin pretty much where the main section of the book ended, so I am eager to see where they go with the story.",6,neutral

"We enjoyed season one of The White Lotus but it took a couple episodes to warm up to it. Still, it had some good moments. We didn't experience many out loud chuckles but it was entertaining and it was interesting to see what the next episode would bring. If there was one character We could do without it was Jennifer Coolidge. Her on screen persona is the same in pretty much everything she plays but I guess she fits today's program interests. Some many things in the episodes were predictable but still, it can be entertaining.  Season two seems so flat and we keep waiting for things to get going. The episodes are so full of clichés and not pulled off very well. We keep waiting for some spark that kicks the program into high gear. My wife is ready to pull the plug after three episodes but I'm a sucker and like to see how the season is played out. If I even had a hint of how I would feel about The White Lotus, it would have been scratched from my list of shows to watch. I can't see watching a season 3 if the show makes it that far.",2,negative

"With all the hype that was build up I really was looking forward to see this show. What a huge let down this turned out to be. I found it very confusing. Not only the time-line thing but also the characters and the story I think they were trying to tell. None of the characters drew me in, they were all just to unbelievable and unlikeable. So I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone with standards and anyone who compares this show to GoT: no just no!",1,negative
"I'm going to be honest: I had not watched any of the Star Wars movies when I started watching The Mandalorian. I didn't know if I would like Star Wars at all, but I loved The Mandalorian from the first episode. I didn't have anything to compare it to, but I just loved it. Then I watched the Original Trilogy, and now I like the Mandalorian even better. Dave Filoni and John Favreau did an amazing job capturing that amazing vibe. Keep up the good work!",7,neutral
"I love the Reacher books, and am enjoying the TV version. Unfortunately it is a shame that the budget doesn't seem to stretch to better actors. I don't recognise any of them and some of the are just awful. The writing is a bit clunky and the director is just not doing his job when really badly delivered lines are allowed into the final cut. I also am disappointed in the amount of effing and jeffing in the show; the books contain very little strong language but the TV version is peppered with unnecessary F bombs which grate on me. American shows seem to think they have to do this now and are ruining good shows. The good wife was ruined by it,and only murders in the building could be good but the language spoiled.  Let's get some quality into the next series please.",7,neutral

"I'm an avid fan of the novels. I've read the first few at least half a dozen times over the years, and I was predestined to hate this show. In fact, I held off on it for a year and a half until I finally decided to dive in and get my rage train steaming.  The first three or four episodes floored me with their faithfulness. I was so excited to the point I quoted lines out loud and just like that, out of the actors' mouths they came. I couldn't believe in the current year that Hollywood writers would actually take a backseat and let the original text speak for itself.  Then the changes began. Minor ones that didn't really matter; for example, swapping an airport for a train station. I get it, filming in the world's busiest terminal is not going to be easy, not even with infinite Bezosbucks. It didn't make a difference since the scene still played out the same. Then huge changes just hit out of nowhere. You'll know it if you read the books and it was like a blindside gut punch. What really got me angry was, like 100% of Hollywood ""adaptations,"" they were 100% unnecessary. The original story was already impeccable, obviously, otherwise Amazon wouldn't have spent untold millions producing it and Child wouldn't still be writing them going on thirty years. Good changes? Only one I can think of: Neagley. Other than that it just proves to me that scriptwriters are jealous and frustrated at their lack of personal success and instead find glee in twisting what doesn't need to be twisted.  Even so, I watched all eight episodes straight through with only toilet breaks. I loved the movies with Tom Cruise, but Ritchson is far, far closer to my mental image of what Reacher would look like. A bit more body builder and a bit less Army body, sure, but his characteristics, mannerisms, and delivery means the casting department crushed it. The rest of the actors were excellent as well, particularly Willa Fitzgerald and the mayor, but I simply cannot get around the fact that changes were made when none were required.  Still worth watching. Double so if you've never read the book.",9,positive
"What an awesome show. It's a space western feelgood sci-fi political gunslinger drama Star Wars-fanboy series from hell! An absolute must watch if you're even remotely into Star Wars. The Mandalorian explores a lot of fan favorite and expanded universe stuff, but also answers a lot of Star Wars questions and trivia that never makes it to the big movie plots. And it features a lot of fan favorite characters from The Clone Wars or even from Legends. You can tell the writer really knows his stuff. It's a show that is less about the good an the bad, struggling for the throne of the galaxy. But more about the struggle between the good, the bad and the ugly reality of living in a desolate outskirt, far away from ""the civilized core"". It's a story about ""simple men, trying to make their way in the galaxy"".",1,negative
"It may be just me but what started off as an innovative, stylish, cool and powerful drama for possibly three series has lost touch with its origins since series four.  Since then it has become a victim of its own hype. It looks good still, the production values remain high but does anyone really care what is happening anymore.  Once it lost its Birmingham roots, Peaky Blinders lost its soul. Yet another series which didn't know when to quit.  Still very stylish but lacking any real substance.",8,positive
"I never write reviews and this is my absolute first one. But this show's worth it.  Finally, a show not made for kids. And because of that, the only one worth watching these days. Since disney ruins their other shows like Boba Fett and Mandalorian when they make it toward children. So they DUMB EVERYTHING DOWN.  But not here. Andor's not holding any hand. And doesn't dumb things down so little children will understand, so they'll want to buy more toys. And because of that, it actually BUILDS INTRIGUE.  Suspence, anticipation and all that really good stuff - Andor's full of it. Stuff you have to have if you want your show to be watchable, episode after episode.  The world actually feels lived in and serious. The Empire's a constant MASSIVE danger. The good and bad stuff happens to both protagonists and antagonists. And pretty unexpectedly.  It's simply a smart show. 10/10 just for that. It's one of the best shows of the decade and I don't even like most of Star Wars. At least what it's become.",7,neutral

"Peaky Blinders is a show that undoubtedly captured the imagination of many with its slick visuals, gritty atmosphere, and charismatic characters. However, beneath its stylish exterior, the series offers little in terms of narrative or character depth, leaving much to be desired for viewers seeking a truly engaging and layered story.  For those drawn to ""sigma/alpha"" archetype, Peaky Blinders might serve as an entertaining, even aspirational, viewing experience. Its protagonists, led by the enigmatic Thomas Shelby, exude a brooding confidence and power that may resonate with individuals influenced by such ideals. The show crafts a world where masculinity, dominance, and a refusal to show vulnerability are idealized, making it appealing for those inclined toward superficial depictions of strength and control.  However, this veneer begins to wear thin as the series progresses. While the first couple of seasons may be enjoyable, the lack of meaningful development in both the story and its characters becomes glaringly apparent. The characters remain static, trapped within their archetypes, with little effort made to explore their internal conflicts, motivations, or growth. Similarly, the story begins to feel repetitive and predictable, relying heavily on style rather than substance to maintain interest.  By the later seasons, the novelty has worn off, and what was once engaging becomes tiresome. Without any added depth or complexity, the characters lose their relevance, and the plot struggles to hold the viewer's attention. What might initially feel like a bold and gripping tale of ambition and power ultimately comes across as a superficial exercise in aesthetic and attitude, with no deeper commentary or emotional resonance.  In summary, Peaky Blinders is a show that might appeal to those seeking a surface-level portrayal of ""alpha"" ideals and stylish rebellion. However, for those looking for a narrative with genuine depth and characters that evolve, it falls short, becoming increasingly hollow and predictable as the series drags on. While it has its moments of intrigue, it ultimately lacks the substance to be truly impactful.",10,positive
"Honestly, I was not planning on watching this series because I'm stubborn and thought that nothing could get even close to what the game is because The Last of Us is certainly one of the most memorable games I have ever played, and it's so well done that I thought the series could ruin that.  Truth is I was wrong. They took the original plot but portrayed it in a way that it seemed like an original one and it felt really refreshing. As I supposed, it's not at the level of the game but it's pretty damn close, the only reason I gave 9 and not 10 stars is because I feel like the answers to every question were given on a silver platter and that took away a bit of the mystery part of discovering what is going on as you go on with the story.  Makeup, scenography and photography team, I kneel before you. They made an exceptional job and I think it just couldn't be better. The scenery is as flawless as in the game, and the FX work is sublime. I watched a few backstage content clips and all the effort that was put into this project was definitely worth it and appreciated.  Acting is also something that deeply influenced the score. I was a bit concerned because of the casting but they just shut my mouth completely because it was a match made in heaven. I was pretty excited to see Pedro Pascal because I'm also Chilean, but his acting is just so on point that it made me difficult not to empathize with him. Joel's character development has always been one of my favourites and he just made an incredible job!  Ellie left me speechless as well. Bella Ramsey is an absolute genius and I couldn't believe she is British! I was reluctant at first because I felt that the physical resemblance was a big deal, but I genuinely forgot about it like two minutes in because she did an impeccable job.  In conclusion, I got humbled so bad I cringed at myself. Also, I really loved that Merle Dandridge got to play Marlene again! I would definitely recommend this series to anyone, including people who are familiar with the game and people who are not.",9,positive

This show definitely lost its soul.  10/10 for the first season. 5/10 for the second one.",9,positive
"In the 1980s, the only way for women to be able to get pregnant was probably via intercourse. The movie assumes this as well, yet takes place after the advent of mobile phones and uber?  Clearly, the person who wrote this script is a male and is CLUELESS about fertility!! Most men today are still stupid/misinformed and think the best or only way for a women to get pregnant is by coitus.  The odds of women getting pregnant (success rate) via sexual intercourse decrease after the first 50 menstrual cycles and the odds are like winning a lottery in comparison to IVF. It can take couples up to a year to get pregnant! Not to go into detail, but the spermatozoa has a long way to travel to fertilize the female ova for a women to pregnant via coitus. The endometrium is shed through every menstrual cycle. Many men have damaged sperm, low sperm count, because they consume to much food with estrogen or don't wait long enough for sperm to form or due to age. Following ovulation, the female's egg is capable of fertilization for only 12 to 24 hours! YES, THAT IS RIGHT, 24-48 hours!  In today's day and age, doctors can insert the sperm directly through the cervix. Doctors can even insert a fertilized egg. ""IVF is the process of fertilization by extracting eggs, retrieving a sperm sample, and then manually combining an egg and sperm in a laboratory dish.""  Most women who want to get pregnant go through IVF today, an option unavailable to women when this book was written. I don't know a single women who didn't get pregnant on a first try with IVF; each had spent years trying to get pregnant the ""natural way."" In a totalitarian, post uber and mobile phones, world, women would not be getting pregnant via sex like slaves.  This show would have made a lot more sense if it took place in the 1980s. Technology has advanced far too much for this show to be remotely close to what a dystopian world would look like today. Everyone today knows that coitus has the lowest success rate for conceiving with age.  Also, people crossing over to Canada to get away from the regime? Are you serious? What about running to the Indian reserves in every U.S. state or the Amish communities. I read somewhere that the person who wrote the script for this movie visited Iran and got information about Islam from the UN and based the script off of that. If you want to make a show about Muslim women than make the show about Muslim women. This show is absurd, not a U.S. dystopian reality in this day and age.  I give this movie 5/10 because the acting is good.",8,positive

"As a very thirsty and disappointed Star Wars fan- this series is simply refreshing. I'm baffled as to how many times they got it wrong (with the exception of Rogue One) as of late before dropping a gem like this for all to enjoy.  I feel my I resonate with many reviews on here: It gets Star Wars right. It is honestly some of the best character oriented storytelling where the product doesn't suffer or feel flimsy for inane reasons... It's just great writing mixed with some fantastic directing. There's so much that this show gets right:   Proper strong female characters Having an appreciation and respect for the original source material in a way that doesn't create unnecessary inconsistencies Various acknowledgments of and references to the Star Wars EU Commonly exhibited approach of 'less is more' which leads to no distractions and a fine balance between build up and pay-off that the viewer is genuinely interested in... I find that Star Wars has suffered in this department the most as of late Great casting choices   I could keep going but I'll stop myself while I'm ahead. I highly recommend the show to anyone that is into Star Wars, enjoys Sci-Fi (especially if you're a Firefly fan) or good character oriented storytelling in general.  Disney: Please don't screw this up with needless meddling. Let the people working their magic to their own devices cause this series is single-handedly carrying the entire franchise on its back right now.",9,positive
"I got really hyped when The Last of Us was announced to be made, especially by HBO and the partnership between Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin.  Druckmann is the one who gave us this incredible story, developed it in the Part 2 and managed to stick to the game foundations, keeping up the pace, the range of emotions and the impact it will have on you.  First episode looks promising, all the teasers and released materials so far are heavily linked with the atmosphere of the game and I can't wait to see more!  I can link the dynamics, dialogues and the overall atmosphere with the one I've experienced in the game  I was a bit disappointed when Bella Ramsey was set for Ellie's role. I thought Kaitlyn Dever would be the perfect fit for the character - visually and from her performances, I saw her as the one for the role.  Still, time will tell if Ramsey was the right pick for it.  As someone who played both games, I found it surprising that they've added a few things to the series on top of the experience from the original games. But these surprises are good! It adds up to the story Druckmann was telling us in the games, so they are very welcome.  To all the people who hadn't played the games - sit back, enjoy the ride of emotions and events and I hope they will end it right, same way as they've started it.",3,negative

Wednesday is a warm, kind, wise, and calm girl. She may get into trouble only because she has very different habits and conception of everything.

They've added enough extra that weren't from the game to give the story and characters that little bit more depth but at the same time staying absolutely true to the original storyline. They've even kept a lot of the original dialogue from the game too. As far as video game adaptions go, this is by far the best I have ever seen from one. Even though I already knew the plot, it still kept me extremely excited to see how it would play out. Even if you haven't played the game, I still highly recommend watching this show as it's absolutely phenomenal... perfect 10/10 for me.",10,positive

"I have never read the books or played any of the games. I had been anticipating this show for some time, however, because I am a huge fan of Henry Cavil, and I wanted something to ease my disappointment with Game of Thrones. Having said all of this, people who say this show is hard to follow or even impossible to understand without the context given by the books and games are dead wrong. Just because this is a show that requires your complete attention and doesn't allow for you to sit on your phone with it playing in the background DOES NOT make it confusing to the point of being unwatchable. I actually find the nonlinear timelines to be incredibly refreshing and an interesting way to tell a story. It felt so good to reach episode four or five and finally see how each of the three main characters' stories intertwined with each other.  Henry is absolutely incredible in this, and he easily steals the show. Additionally, Jaskier is an annoying character at first, but the dynamic between him and Geralt soon becomes very entertaining and good comedic relief (almost reminds me of siblings picking on one another). Yennefer's storyline is very poignant and engrossing, and I did not find it difficult to empathize with her or Geralt's struggles in their world. This show is not without it flaws, as I did find Ciri's storyline to be a little boring and redundant, but every other amazing aspect of the series more than makes up for the few shortcomings of the writers. The fight choreography, acting skills of the three main characters, and the worldbuilding of a very new and intriguing fantasy world all make this show a 10/10 in my book.  I made an account after using IMDb for years solely because the negative reviews were making me so angry. Sure, I had questions about some aspects of the world and some of the lore behind it, but I also like elements of mystery and don't need everything explicitly explained to me like I am a child. The converging timelines are confusing, but it feels so cool when you finally understand what is happening (and again, it's really not something that needs to be explicitly explained unless you are not paying attention or skipping episodes *cough* EW *cough*). This show has mistakes as any first season of a show is bound to have, but all of the people leaving such negative reviews are just plain wrong and just mad that they don't immediately understand every little thing that is said or happens on screen. Pay attention, think a little bit, and you will not regret watching. I really think this show has the potential to be even better than Thrones, and I am eagerly awaiting season two.",8,positive
"I watched Andor when it first came out and thought it was some of the best tv I'd ever seen. I watched it again recently to see if I was mistaken. I definitely wasn't.  Firstly, to deal with the criticism about the pacing - if you want fast-paced action, go watch Fast & Furious 27.  Action is used more sparingly in this show compared to other Star Wars titles, so the other aspects of storytelling are more prominent. The quality is so high for all aspects of production, particularly writing. There are a couple of monologues, from some of the show's great characters, that sent shivers down my spine.  What I liked most about about the series is that it changes tone from other SW films/shows by taking a deep dive on what it feels like to live under an oppressive regime. The feeling of constant surveillance, danger and injustice is ever present. My wife, who is originally from a country ruled by a totalitarian government, was at first uninterested (probably because we watched the Boba Fett and Obi Wan series before this), but got steadily more engrossed as it became clear that the show's creators understand the mechanics of facism. I'm a massive fan of this genre, and it works so well in the SW universe for some reason.  The only minor critique I have is that there are very few aliens, which is a bit strange for Star Wars. But perhaps a Tatooine cantina scene would have taken something away from Andor's dark, dystopian atmosphere?  Overall this is an incredibly well made show which deviates into a new, and more mature, narrative for Star Wars; which is very welcome!",10,positive

"The plot points can be seen coming from a mile away, everything is written for effect instead of logic and hardly any idea is really creative. Nothing happens organically, everything happens because the screenplay says so. I've seen video games with better storytelling.  The fan-service is pretty over the top sometimes. Still not as bad as the recent movies, but if you are not a die-hard fan who loves every corner of Mos Eisley cantina and holds his breath at the sight of a light saber, it's getting annoying.  What really pisses me off is that there is no writing cleverness anywhere, not even in the details. It's like watching a 6-year-old perform a magic trick. Even worse, with Season 2 they rip off other Scifi franchises in quite blatant fashion.  It's a pity, because the visuals are great, the designs are amazing, there is so much love in the look of this. And you see the budget on the screen, the effects are great, there are massive scenes with complex cheography and the world feels properly alive. The actors also do a fine job with what they are given.  But it's ultimately just spectacle lacking any common sense. If you breath Star Wars, you'll like. Otherwise stay away.",6,neutral
"This is one of the zaniest, most brilliant, original programmes ever made to date.  Once you realise that every character is a dysfunctional human being the whole thing clicks into place. It's huge fun and hugely funny, whilst at the same time throwing a spotlight onto the darkest recesses of human existence.  The cinematography is superb, not only because of the beautiful on-location filming, but because it's shot so darned cleverly.  The acting is across-the-board outstanding. Just brilliant characters, beautifully portrayed.  The music is as mad and wonderful and totally complementary.

"Very entertaining series. I thought the Tom Cruise films were decent even if he bore very little resemblance to the character from the books, but Cruise is a geezer and they were watchable enough. This versions great though. Personally it seems to me as much of a comedy as a crime thriller, it's beyond far-fetched but it's true to the books, which also stretch credulity to just shy of breaking point. They're pulpy thrillers though that are meant to be wolfed down like a bag of nice greasy fast food, not pored over and analysed like some weighty piece of literature, and they work on those terms. That's what make this show so entertaining, it doesn't mess with the formula and stays true to the ethos that makes the books so fun. This should be taught in film school as a perfect example of how to adapt source material. I give it ten biceps out of ten.",7,neutral
"So I thought this was going to be God awful like most Netflix adaptations, but I found myself laughing and appreciating the camerawork, the clothes, the colors, the acting etc. The way everything is colorful and vibrant while Wednesday is just colorless and unemotional makes Wednesday stick out so much from being so out of place. You almost can feel how much she dislikes almost everything. She's smart, witty, and honestly kind of scary. Catherine Zeta Jones made me a believer in her from her performance. From start to finish this was a easy and fun watch. It almost flew by too fast and now want more.",8,positive
"Lifetime Star Wars fan despite many recent damp quibs, especially Boba Fett! Quite simply, Andor makes the whole saga relatable - you can really get a feel for what made the rebellion and how oppressive the empire was. Each character is deep, well written and acted. For me, it probably wouldn't work as a stand alone but it underpins all that has gone before and makes the fantasy soemething that is more believable and understandable. The relatively insignificant (in the context of the movies) challenges that Andor faces throughout help to convey the frustration of being under Emire control, as such you find yourself routing for and celebrating each win as much as a movie ending battle. Absolutely loved this.",7,neutral

"Adapting a beloved video game like The Last of Us is a risky endeavor. Fans expect not just a faithful recreation of plot points, but an emotional and thematic alignment with the original. HBO's The Last of Us doesn't just rise to that challenge-it absolutely crushes it. This series is a masterclass in how to stay true to a source while expanding it with care and purpose.  From the opening scene, it's clear the creators understand what made the game so impactful: the emotional storytelling, the lived-in world, and the deeply human relationships at its core. The show faithfully follows the story of Joel and Ellie-two unlikely companions navigating a post-apocalyptic America ravaged by a fungal infection turning people into monsters. But the real story isn't about zombies; it's about love, grief, survival, and what we're willing to do for the people we care about.  Pedro Pascal's portrayal of Joel is pitch-perfect. He brings a quiet intensity and buried vulnerability that echoes the game while making the character his own. Bella Ramsey delivers a fearless, layered performance as Ellie, capturing her wit, trauma, and deep need for connection. Together, they form a relationship that feels real, raw, and heartbreaking-just like in the game.  What sets this adaptation apart is its unwavering commitment to authenticity. So many moments feel lifted directly from the game-from the tragic prologue to the unforgettable giraffe scene. But the show doesn't stop at re-creation. It adds depth where the game hinted, and expands side characters in ways that enrich the story. The standout episode featuring Bill and Frank is a perfect example. What was a tragic footnote in the game becomes a full, emotionally devastating arc in the show, showcasing how love can flourish, even in the darkest times.  The attention to detail is also worth celebrating. Visually, the world looks like it was torn straight from the screen: decaying cities, overgrown highways, and terrifyingly accurate infected. The practical effects on the Clickers are especially impressive-every twitch, every scream, every moment of horror feels earned. The show doesn't rely on jump scares; it builds tension with atmosphere and silence, just like the game.  Sound plays a crucial role too. Gustavo Santaolalla's iconic score returns, and it brings with it all the emotional weight of the original. Hearing those familiar guitar strings behind key scenes reinforces just how faithful this adaptation is-not only in plot, but in tone and heart.  That's not to say the show is afraid to take risks. It introduces new characters, rearranges a few events, and tones down the action in places. But none of these changes feel out of place. They serve the story and the characters, making the show accessible for newcomers while still deeply rewarding for fans.  Most importantly, The Last of Us understands its emotional core. It's a story about what it means to love when everything else is gone. About the hope we cling to and the pain we carry. The show leans into those themes with subtlety and power, never forgetting what made the game such a masterpiece in the first place.  HBO's The Last of Us sets a new standard for video game adaptations. It honors the source material with respect and care, all while using the strengths of television to go deeper, richer, and more human. Whether you've played the game a dozen times or are discovering this world for the first time, this series is unforgettable.",10,positive
"The White Lotus: Season 1 (2021)  Before you get looped into this the same way that I was, I must warn you that despite how the show starts, this is not some sort of Agatha Christie murder mystery. In fact, this is a series about a group of highly unlikeable characters delivering the most cringe-worthy dialogue that I have seen on TV. I loathed every single one of them and yet, I found myself watching episode after episode. Despite it's unbearable nature, the show was never boring and I was curious to see what would happen next because it looked good and that devilishly hypnotic soundtrack kept me coming back.  The White Lotus is about a bunch of people who go to a high end Hawaiian hotel for a vacation. They don't know each other and don't care to know each other because of who they are. Nearly everyone is a piece of work whether you take the obnoxiously ungrateful children or the incompetent hotel staff. The dialogue made me roll my eyes so much that I had to wind them back up in the opposite direction. I think I hated everyone except Steve Zahn, but once I got passed the infinite fog of the cringe, I was able to see that this was actually a solid societal satire and some characters actually had good development arcs.  White Lotus had good intentions of depicting people in an insufferable fashion where they either become worse or go through some ""journey"" only to realize that it's much easier to remain who they are. Sadly despite the terrific acting from the cast, the narrative felt all over the place due to lack of focus. The challenge with this series is actually getting through that fog in order to be able to see the satirical narratives. I think the brilliance of the show is that the biggest preachers of ""righteousness"" end up being the villains or idiots. Admittedly, despite feeling hateful and uncomfortable, I couldn't stop watching because of the neat pacing and high production value. Watch a couple of episodes and if you are blessed with patience, then you might have a good time.  P. S. Separate mention for the brilliant soundtrack which I now listen to every other day.

"I didn't have to try to like Peaky Blinders .. Everything about it felt like a revolution in TV drama .. I think I even compared it to The Sopranos .. I'd heard the criticisms of the gratuitous, indie-soundtracked slow motion shots, and mumbled, breathy dialogue, but brushed them off .. Before long I'd bought the first season DVD boxset and sprouted a 1920s military haircut ... Unfortunately the sheen and style of the series wears off eventually .. About halfway through season 2, I suddenly became aware of the complete absence of any kind of compelling narrative .. Evidently things happened, but by now the monotone delivery and haircuts felt like they had nowhere to go .. I read an interview with the writer, Steven Knight, in which he boasted about how he'd already got nearly a dozen seasons written, and could reel off a script in an afternoon .. Well, great work if you can get it, but a stark contrast to the year-long team-writing process behind a single season of Breaking Bad .. Where Breaking Bad creates a narrative worthy of a Russian novel, and The Sopranos shows profound insight into the human condition, an episode of Peaky Blinders feels like 10 minutes of hastily scrawled script, padded out with brooding shots of people smoking in dark rooms, walking in slow motion, and generally loving the smell of their own farts over a one-dimensional selection of 90s and 00s indie .. In fact it's astonishing to me that an episode of The Sopranos and Peaky Blinders run to about the same length, as where each episode of The Sopranos feels like a self-contained movie; an episode of Peaky Blinders has less script than the average Jay-Z video .. All in all, a huge missed opportunity - a show that gets so much right, but fails to look beyond its own style for anything resembling a story or character development.",8,positive
"The Handmaid's Tale started out ok for me. But in looking at almost 500 hours of watching it seemed overwhelming which I've never felt before in watching a series. A little too much TV for me! I kept on but felt I was getting bored mid way through the 2nd Season. Fun to watch my local area throughout..even shots down the street from me. And also celebrating a Canadian author in Margaret Atwood. The latter two are worth a couple of stars. I have to say though..''The Blessed Be"" and other 'religious ' sayings made me quiver everytime. Not in a good way.",10,positive
"One of the most oppressive series ever seen, but that actually only concerns the first season. A dystopian, gloomy worldview that is less unthinkable than we might think and shows what humanity is capable of.  I don't often want to watch series a second time, but for Handmaid's Tale s1 I make an exception.  Seasons 2 and 3 are also very worthwhile, but after that it quickly becomes less to a fairly mediocre series. I hope there will not be a follow-up season, that will then only be motivated by commercial reasons.  But again, the theme and its development in season 1: brilliant and for me 10 out of 10. Seasons 2 and 3 a 7.5. Seasons 4 and 5 a rating of 5 out of 10.",7,neutral
"This show was one of the best shows I have seen. I was so excited for season 4 and they deliver this confusing mess. I'm starting to not like June, so many plot holes and inconsistencies.

Whoever wrote and directed this crap should be put on the wall.",6,neutral
"As a life long fan devotee of Charles Addam's creepy and kooky family, I will be very judgmental of every adaptation that comes our way, and I have to say this mysterious and spooky series is amazing.  Jenna Ortega shines as the oldest Addams' daughter, it's almost as if she was born to play the child of woe. Ortega transformation into Wednesday seems effortless, she has all the quirks, coldness and mean insults associated with her, but in such an expert hands, Wednesday does not seem cartoonish nor one-dimensional, she is portrayed with incredible depth.  The series is also directed by Tim Burton, and his love for the macabre and Hammer Horror us incredibly noticeable here, and so is his dark sense of humor.  The supporting cast is incredible as well, specially Emma Myers as Enid, her colorful personality are a surprisingly well match for our color deprived protagonist.  If you were a fan of Wednesday Addams before you will love the series, id the character is new to you this series will make you fall for her.  A Gothic murder mystery with a twist of irreverent dark humor, there are not enough words to praise this series.",10,positive
"Series 4 does not go well for the future of the series, the first episode was excellent but then it was shorts of cowboys going cowboy things and Beth being a bitch (at times unhinged).  It seems the writers have run out of plot, the same old plots from Series 1 & 2 are recovered over & over, the ranch hands get too many lines and too much air time, everyone on Yellowstone seem to spend their days sitting around feeling sorry for themselves doing stupid things, every now & then someone gets killed for at times obscure reasons, the local Indians sit around looking wise but not really doing very much, except for the several stunning looking Indian girls who just seem to want to fall in love with anyone who comes along.  Kevin Costner just sighs a lot, speaks in gravel tones while attempting to be wise, he's become pretty dull and has lost control of his mentally disturbed daughter.  If there isn't an injection of plot, it's over...",10,positive

What a pleasant surprise from Mr. Tim! What amazing performance by miss Ortega and Ms Christie! I really liked the direction they took this! I personally wasn't a fan of the animated series but this one surprised me so much and was not what I was expecting at all! Can we please please please have a season two! I want to know more about the characters and future adventures by Wednesday and the school! I want to see more of thing and the roommate too! It really takes a lot yo get my attention for series but I'm glad I listened yo my friends and tried this one out! You should try this one out too you won't be disappointed!,7,neutral

"The last couple of seasons were overly-drawn out, with limited movement in the story, and completely painful to watch. Not painful in the content like the first couple of seasons were painful to watch bc of how horrific this dystopian society is, but painful in the ""you're trying too hard"" way. I cannot tell you how much I hate seeing Moss' face from all the absurdly long, dark, wanna-be art scenes. I honestly feel like Elisabeth Moss is a narcissist, who needed to have her face front and center for every shot, because everything is about HER!  The most exciting episode in those last couple of seasons, was the episode before the series finale. They could have done without an actual series finale and ended on that episode. Yet any kind of impact from that episode was ruined by the useless series finale. I can confidently say, that series finale is on-par with the Dexter series finale.  I really hate to leave a low rating such a strong dystopian story, that started very strong, and created an impact! However, the last couple of seasons were so horrendous that my faith and ability to watch the show seriously were hindered.",10,positive
"As a history major and gangster enthusiast, this series had it all for me. The show had great cinematography, actors, and the story line was phenomenal. I wanted to wait until watching the final season to write the review in case it had a GOT style crash and burn. It did not. I want to go on describing but it's hard to do without spoilers but I would definitely put this up with other gangster series greats such as Sopranos, Breaking Bad and Ozarks.",10,positive

"I put off watching this series as I just couldn't believe the hype. So, in short I wish I had watched this sooner. I truly believe the best show I have ever watched would be Breaking Bad, I feel Peaky blinders is second only to that. The story lines vary every series but they are all equally well written and well paced. The characters are developed so fantastically and the acting is of a hugely high standard throughout. Yes the accents are a bit iffy in the first series but this does get better and I'm only picky as I'm from Solihull (Birmingham) The suspense almost kills you at times, especially at the end of series 5 where my palms were drenched. Everybody talks about Cillian Murphy as Tommy Shelby and rightly so as he is masterful but the whole cast are superb. Definitely give it a watch, it's never dull, very well paced and it will leave you obsessed.",10,positive
"I have been a huge Mandalorian fan since the first time I saw Bobba Fett in action in Return of the Jedi. Through out decades of curiosity and my own imagination I have always wanted to see more of the Mandalorians. Jango was decent but didnt have as big of a part as I had hoped. This series far exceeds my years of fantasy. I am very pleased to see how well Disney has done on this series, even with my own scepticism after they bought Lucas Films and the flop of Force Awakens and the Last Jedi. I have seen reviews that baby Yoda is why this does so well but in fact, it is the honor and integrity of this secret society that makes the Mandalorians so intriguing. I want more and cant wait to see where this series goes. If I had to say one word that best describes this intense series I would have to describe it as ""Spectacular""!",10,positive
"Below is the first review I gave for The Last of Us. I have recently been talked into watching the rest of episode 2, then episodes 3 and 4. It's a great show, aside from episode 1. Episode 3 really hits the heart. I've read reviews on here critizing episode 3, but I'd say those people probably don't have a heart. Because I'm embarrassed, I left the old review below. I was wrong. Watch it!  ....I can't believe all the high ratings. There is no way you can tell me this many people watched two episodes and rated this high - no way. Granted the beginning was intriging, but went downhill fast.  I'm trying to get into the show, but I don't think the actors can keep a straight face with this juvenile script, the dialogue sounds like it was written by a child on ritalin. Speaking of children, the little girl who they're supposedly saving, seems annoyed by it all, with her spurty, uncaring performance. Awful.  I made through episode two, but it took me about a dozen sittings to do it. I am however, left with a range of emotions none good. What a waste of time.",9,positive
"Big fan of the books. Aside from TV adaptation liberties, (like cramming multiple books into an episode) this is a more correct portrayal.

"Peaky Blinders feels like an English take on US series, Boardwalk Empire. The fact is, this English series simply lacks the soul found in its American counterpart.  What set Boardwalk apart from pretenders, is precisely what is missing from Peaky Blinders. Deep, emotionally rounded characters inhabit the world of Boardwalk, whereas Peaky feels rather flat. Its not the casts fault but, instead, it has more to do with very ""closed off"" characterizations and limited narrative. The result is a series that's difficult to relate to beyond the superficial. Indeed, this series looks like a serious drama but behaves more like an exposition driven gangster/crime series.  Some of the elements in the storytelling are more than a little bit far fetched too. Especially as the series heads into season three.  All in all, I don't dislike Peaky Blinders but I'm not going to flatter it simply because it can afford good sets and acting talent, when a lot else that should be in the formula is absent. Six out of ten from me.",10,positive
"In spite of having a great cast and great cinematography, the show is way overrated. The storyline is not unique and the plots are too predictable. The show is really slow with unnecessary sassy shots of the blinders walking in macho style. The character development of the police chief in season 1 and 2 is a joke and makes no sense. One can easily avoid this show.",10,positive
"Isn't it interesting how they can take something with comedic origins, and turn it into a mystery drama?  Wednesday's character is dark, brooding, macabre. She's determined and tenacious and apparently suffers from anhedonia in that she doesn't experience joy. During the entire series I saw a hint of a smile only once.  Her affect is flattened as though severely depressed or on antidepressants. She shows no emotion but for an occasional look of terror and she's essentially friendless save Thing. She's quick witted, not in the habit of exchanging niceties and her barbs will cut you like a knife.  Her gait is stiff and unyielding and she never swings her arms. All in all Wednesday Addams is just an effing delight.  But these qualities are necessary. Every aspect of her mystery solving is deliberate and she makes it incredibly difficult to get in her way. She cannot be intimidated and she'll never give up.  It's fun to watch her at work as you know she'll solve the mystery. But is death looming? Let's see. Only Fester makes her smile.",10,positive

The only thing I wished is that it wasn't so addictive, I'm staying up way too late binge watching it, yes it's 2am, yes I have work in the morning, ah sod it I'll watch one more.",10,positive
"This series is all buildup and no pay off. The whole cast complains the whole time, jennifer cooladges comedic talent is wasted on her just making scrunchy faces, the writing is just not creative or clever. It was just the most boring thing ever. The end of the final episode is a little interesting but you dont even have any time to enjoy it. Nine Perfect Strangers was very mediocre but it was better than this show, but thats not saying much. I think the writers thought awkwardness = cringe humor but it just falls flat.",1,negative
"The best thing about this show is Jenna Ortega's performance and how likeable her character gets with time. The casting felt great. Catherine Zeta Jones made a perfect Morticia.  The plot is intriguing and entire series is very engaging. What's most tasteful are the dialogues and the way lines are framed, used and delivered. Makes me want to rewatch this emtire series again (have watched it twice already).  Timing wise, it never felt like the show's too long or too short. Felt just right. Didn't even realise how I ended up binging 6 episodes in one go.  Tim Burton has a way of making people appreciate dark themed stories and characters and he does it exceedingly well here too.  Above everything, what truly made this entire series stand out is Jenna Ortega's performance. She truly captured the essence of Wednesday and portrayed it so richly in every manner (gestures, gaze, moves, mood, voice). Definitely looking forward to viewing more seasons.",10,positive
"I am quite literally obsessed with this show, I didn't start watching till there was 3 seasons and I just binge watched them.  All the characters are incredible, very handsome cowboys and beautiful woman.  I especially love the plot and how there are prequels to YS detailing the Dutton line and why things are the way they are.  The show keeps you on the edge of your seat, there's a lot of shock moments.  The character Beth is my favourite, she is so confident and fierce.  It's almost like stepping back in time when you're watching this show, the cowboys are so funny and I love that they cast real cowboys in the show too.

"When someone mentions Jack Reacher, you know exactly what's coming: shattered jaws, loaded stares, and justice delivered with a clenched fist. In this third season, not only does he not disappoint-he delivers exactly what you'd hope for... and then some.  Reacher crashes back into action like a principled wrecking ball, facing a new case, fresh allies, and a few familiar faces. The formula? Same as always, but sharper. Brutal action, dry humor, no-nonsense dialogue, and a lead who proves brains and brawn can go hand in hand. Alan Ritchson has nailed it so well it's hard to picture anyone else in the role. He is Reacher, no doubt.  The show doesn't try to be high art, and it doesn't need to. It knows exactly what it is: pure entertainment, with the charm of a really good airport thriller-well-executed shootouts and a story that moves forward without wasting a second on fluff. And the best part? It works. Every season keeps the bar high, and this third one even dares to throw in new twists and settings that refresh the pace without losing its soul.  Some may say it's ""more of the same,"" but when the same is done this well, there's nothing to complain about. Because yeah-watching Reacher hand out justice his way is one of those little cathartic pleasures you never really get tired of. And when the team behind him gets the tone just right and doesn't take itself too seriously, the result hits the mark once again.  If you enjoyed the previous seasons, this one won't let you down. And if you haven't jumped in yet... what are you waiting for?",10,positive

"For me this series was so incredible in showcasing the psyche and changes in each character. The storyline is without doubt a peace of art, but the real magic in the series is when you look back to season 1 and you realize how perfectly they described the development of each individual person. Every character has it's own mystery and something unique, both good and bad, in them, and the writers did incredible job conveying that through the progression of the story. All recommendations for this one :)",10,positive
"As a gamer, I can finally say: This game adaptation was perfect. Casting, cinematography, visual effects, story... 10/10. They have changed some stuff from the source material, but till now, everything was done ""surprisngly"" better. Even if you've played the game, it will hit you HARD and maybe even harder. We only have 1ep and its shaping to be the best series not just the best video game adaptation. HBO is lucky to give this story a chance.  One negative is that we need to wait a week for the next episode. Can't wait for the rest and explore more about the world of the last of us and its characters.",10,positive

Alan Ritchson is also not 6'5"" and 250 lb, he is over 6' and over 200 lb he is very believable in the role.  I watched the first episode, and then binge watched the rest of series 1.

The male characters are all jerks and the female characters are catty or whiny. I understand building tension and drama in a show but this is four episodes of repetition and characters literally repeating themselves over and over. Honestly I don't understand what Mike White was thinking. There is not one character that I find interesting or entertaining. I'm going to ride it out just to see if I'm missing something or to see if anything interesting happens. If this season continues on this course, I pray that it is the last season.",7,neutral
"A very disappointing series. I've watched series 1 with my partner and we were desperately seeking the big twist or hard hitting moment especially considering the way the 1st episode starts. If you're looking for something with a big mystery or thriller aspects, don't watch this. This is very much American humour, you know, things that are barely funny being lauded by critics as hilarious, think every Amy Schumer movie you've ever been forced to watch.  Jennifer Coolidge plays Jennifer Coolidge, I swear she was the exact same character in the last thing I seen her in....sadly she is probably the best part of the entire series with her typical dumb blonde character.  It feels more like a faux behind the scenes look at how a luxury resort is run by an alcoholic, drug taking manager. Watch families and newly wed couples have arguments and tantrums. Watch them leave the resort.  We were on episode 4 and saying, I dont think this is going where we want it to go. It just faded out with a whimper.",7,neutral

At least they can erase digital space and use it for something worthwhile.",1,negative
"I'm not much of a reviewer around here, but this one is truly overrated, probably just because it is this popular franchise.  There is a lot to like, i.e the sci-fi setting, cute visuals, a story with enough to catch on to.

"I have just started series 4, and it is awful. The 1st series was excellent, the men of the British Army of 1918 (arguably the best army Britain ever put in the field) coming home and applying their discipline and attitude to criminal endeavour. It really worked.  The opening hanging scene of series 4 gives fair warning. It is inaccurate at every point. By 20th century the 'noose' was a brass ring woven into the end of the rope (not a rope knot as shown), then positioned under the left ear so when it tightened it ended up under the chin forcing the head back and snapping the neck. For multiple executions prisoners were executed in separate jails, always. The prisoner's arms were strapped behind their back to a belt around their waist, they then prepared by the priest in a separate room, lead to the gallows at the last moment, timed very carefully to be seconds before 8am (outside London). At lightening speed they were led in to the gallows chamber, hustled up the steps, the knees were strapped together (no standing legs akimbo), simultaneously the hood put over the head (prisoners were always hooded in the 20th century), the noose fitted, everybody stepped back and the lever was pulled as the clock struck 8. The prisoner was never left standing on the trapdoor, waiting, and professional hangmen were used to ensure it was all done quickly and smoothly.",10,positive
"I'm not a hardcore fan of the older movies of the starwars series, but I do enjoy them and can see why someone being a teenager when they first released should be the biggest fan in light of the time period. But maybe this makes me look at the series with a more objective eye, not looking for a nostalgic reenactment. I myself thought the latest 3 or 4 star wars movies were some of the most excruciating hours where storytelling had to make way for inclusivity and correctness, a formula that would destroy any form of good storytelling. However, this short series has got me hooked. The stories themselves are not thick or loaded, but light and very entertaining, something I personally really like about the series. It is however the atmosphere, the costumes, environments and the extremely well fit soundtrack that really sucks me into the series. I view it more as a series portraying sketches of a side story in the Star Wars Universe in an excellent manner. If you are looking for extremely thick, intelligent and thought out plots, you most likely end up disappointed. However, I do feel that that is something the movies should be doing and the series does what I would expect from it in the best of manners. The one thing I would want to change is some of the slightly poor acting on the more prominent roles.",10,positive
"I turned on Netflix, I see #1 Wednesday.  I clicked it, I have watched all the episodes in 2 days. The Addams Family is a classic. It's hard to continue something what is already an icon. Tim Burton did it very well. Whole serie was very interesting, lots of plot twists, we can suspect the monster, but then we can change our minds. Confusing puzzles do not allow you to be sure of the ending. Great idea, great production, nice shots, nice camera work, good script (the jokes were really cool). So why 8? T owards the end, Wednesday becomes softer, and maybe I don't really like that. The main character also has two admirers, although Wednesday rejects both of them, but accepts both. Maybe it was the love story that spoiled it a bit. But I enjoyed it. I watched it even twice! Wednesday is smart, funny, dark, maybe she's like some goth college girl, but I don't mind it.  For sure I wasn't expecting this at all, but It was a really nice surprise. I hope the show will be continued, because the end was the beginning of something new.  Jenna Ortega has difficult job to do- continue Christina Ricci's job. Jenna's perfomance was fantastic, she absolutely knows what she's doing and she feels Wednesday. She choreographed a ball dance and it turned out incredible.  Shots are good, young actor's acting is great, scenerio is on point. Just fun show to watch to relax :) I recommend!",10,positive
"The premiere was so awkward one could no longer continue with ""suspension of disbelief"". It was so dull and boring that half way through, a supposed comedy, there was not a single laugh, but lots of cringe-worthy empathy-less caricatures.",1,negative
"I have watched many shows but none of them entraining like Yellowstone since episode one of season one every scene and every dialogue of each character is entertaining, cinematography, acting everything is amazing. Kevin Costner played an amazing role, how he is keeping his promise with his father to protect every inch of his ranch, hats off to the writer, director, Producer and all the team who are creating such a wonderful show to entertain us.  My advise for the viewer if you really want to feel every scene and every character just put your mobile phone on silent, grab a coffee cup sit tight.",10,positive
I still don't like the race bending netflix decided to do with a few characters as I can never take the characters seriously but oh well... The show is still phenomenal and I totally recommend it to witcher fans and medieval fans alike.,9,positive
"Look, this show is basically Xena/Hercules in more ways than one, but with a much less consistent and thoughtful narrative, coupled with very jarring jumps in the timeline that makes it really hard to follow and understand certain character choices, motivations and their overall development.  Yet... I love it. It's fast food, but a very tasty one. The show is simply so much fun, it knows when to and when not to take itself seriously. Henry Cavill is amazing as Geralt and simply chews every scene he is in. Geralt's sidekick, Jaskier (played by Joey Batey) is also brilliant, he brings an inredibly amount of energy and fun to every scene he is in.  The show works the best when these two characters are on the screen together and they are the main reasons to watch The Witcher. The dynamic between these two characters/actors are simply fantastic, their friendly connection reminds me of some of the best movie duos, like Riggs and Murtaugh from Lethal Weapon.  I definitely recommend watching The Witcher. While it's nowhere near as cleverly written in terms of story and characters as the really popular The Witcher III: The Wild Hunt video game, it manages to make up for it in certain ways and it's one of the most fun shows going on right now.",6,neutral
"This show, it's perfection. I've read all the 1 star reviews and I don't agree with most of them, they all say how the show is sloppy and the lines are bad. Let me give you a run down.  Wednesday gets expelled, goes to a new school she doesnt like, finds out there s a murderer loose and gets obsesed over that, love interest is the murderer woohooo.  I liked the show, I honestly didn't expect it to be the love interest, idk why since it was kind of obvious at the start. Jenna carries the show, alot. Personally, my favorite character was thing, a hand can somehow convey emotions, I also particularly liked the actor of Ajax.  I understand why the 1 star reviews are frustrated with the show, a well portrayed character with the same storyline for like 60 years gets a whole new personality, but for me, I haven't watched the 1990's wednesday show, I watched the Addam's Family though, but you have to remember, she is 16 in the show, she was like 12-13 in the 1990's show, and about 6 or something in the 1960's show. I personally disliked Gomez, no offense but he does not look like the old Gomez, I don't see it. His acting is a bit sloppy and badly delivered. I like the fact they brought back the OG Wednesday, Christina Ricci, her acting was well delivered.  Overall, I enjoyed the show and I rewatched it more times than I can remember, I can't wait for season 2. But I'm not a fan of the whole ""Xavier and Wednesday"" thing, I hope they don't make a love triangle again but instead of Tyler it's Xavier.  What I'm trying to say is that I wouldn't've liked the show without the new Wednesday, before you get mad, just know, in my opinion if your gonna remake a show/movie that's been portrayed before, there's no point if you do it with the same concept.",8,positive
"Okay. I didn't know ANYTHING about this show only that the main character was Wednesday Adams and I was actually really surprised about how good it was. The plot follows Wednesday who just moves to a new school for outcasts named ""Nevermore"" and makes some friends there. It eventually occurs to her that there is a monster on the loose, killing almost anything that crosses its path. This show DEFINITELY had some violence and gore. It wasn't as scary as I thought it would be, and there are also some other kind of calmer parts to the show such as romance, friendships, special events, parts that will make you laugh (mostly dark humor), classes, non-human specimens, and school tours. The violence on the first episode hooks you, but it's not too bad. It gets worse once you get to like episode 7. Be prepared for repeated scenes of people getting attacked by the monster (they all get attacked the same way) and make sure if you're younger than 11 to watch with an adult. This show can also be emotional for some people, whether it's happy emotions or sad emotions. I loved this show and I hope you will too if you decide to check it out on Netflix.",8,positive
Kelly Reilly could win an award on this one. She seems to be suited also for the role on another series called Suits.,10,positive
"Cillian Murphy is down right amazing as Thomas Shelby. The rest of the acting is also really good. The cinematography is really top notch. Its exciting, gripping, and deep with character and plot development. So why isnt is a 10 then? Well to be totally honest.....its the choice of music. There are certain times when there is a conflict that the background music switches to this hard driving rockabilly stuff that doesnt fit the time period at all and just makes the entire scene feel a bit corny. In these moments the show starts to feel like songs of anarchy only it's set in 1920s england. It's not a huge deal breaker, but for me it's way out of left field everytime it happens and makes the whole scene feel disingenuous and forced. Because of this the show feels a bit less believable and immersive and takes on an almost novelty feel to it, and it happens often enough for me to not put the show among other recent greats. It's a really good show, but masterpiece?.......that's a bit of a stretch if you ask me.",10,positive
"A dark world where madmen rule a new nation gillead. They went from democracy to a tyranny that bring back the social discrimination, women are beneath men no matter what they were before in the free world, a system that treats fertile women as sex slaves that are to produce children under the God's eye. Everywhere there are spies and under watch for anyone's action against the rules.  The costumes are simple but great as they can pass you the whole vibe of this world. Women depending their status wear green, as they are the aristocracy, brown as they are the help of the house and red as they are the slaves that can produce offsprings to their masters and then tossed to another family.  The characters of this show are amazingly well written and there is chemistry between their interactions. The heroine of the show has the greatest character evolution as she tries to cope with all the craziness and abuse that takes place. She even admitted that she isn't the same woman as she was before and by watching the series you can understand that.  The plot is linear, with a good pace and evolution.",10,positive
"If you're looking for something to watch , you can't go wrong with Peaky Blinders. This show has characters that you become attached to with a story that keeps you watching.

He's just no John Astin. LONG LIVE GOMEZ! Angelica Houston and Raul Julia were so much better as Morticia and Gomez. Still... not Carolyn Jones or John Astin but at least cast well. This is a prime example of just plain ole lazy casting. Could have been oh so much better with proper caring. IDIOTS!",10,positive
"Netflix's Wednesday is a brilliant, enthralling, and refreshingly innovative series that breathes new life into the iconic Addams Family universe. Created by the exceptional minds of Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, this series focuses on the dark, enigmatic, and fiercely intelligent Wednesday Addams, transforming her into the captivating protagonist of a story that masterfully blends mystery, supernatural elements, and dark humour.  Plot and Setting:  Wednesday transports viewers to the eerie and atmospheric Nevermore Academy, a school for outcasts where Wednesday Addams, portrayed with exceptional talent by Jenna Ortega, embarks on a journey of self-discovery and sleuthing. The storyline follows Wednesday as she navigates her way through the unique social dynamics of Nevermore while investigating a series of bizarre murders plaguing the local town of Jericho. The narrative intricately weaves together threads of gothic horror, teen drama, and supernatural mystery, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats throughout.  Character Development and Performances:  Jenna Ortega's portrayal of Wednesday Addams is nothing short of phenomenal. She encapsulates the essence of Wednesday with her deadpan delivery, sardonic wit, and nuanced expressions, adding layers of depth and complexity to a character traditionally known for her macabre humour and detached demeanour. Ortega's Wednesday is fiercely independent, intellectually curious, and emotionally resilient, making her a compelling and relatable heroine for a new generation.  The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances by Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia Addams and Luis Guzmán as Gomez Addams, who bring a fresh yet faithful take on the beloved characters. The dynamic between Wednesday and her family, particularly her strained relationship with Morticia, adds a rich emotional core to the series. Additionally, the diverse ensemble of characters at Nevermore Academy, from the werewolf roommate Enid Sinclair to the enigmatic principal Larissa Weems, each bring their own unique flavour to the narrative, creating a vibrant and eclectic world.  Visual and Cinematic Excellence:  Visually, Wednesday is a feast for the eyes. The show's gothic aesthetic is meticulously crafted, with the architecture of Nevermore Academy, the eerie woods, and the quaint town of Jericho providing the perfect backdrop for the story's dark themes. The costume design is equally impressive, with Wednesday's signature black attire contrasted against the more colourful wardrobes of her peers, highlighting her uniqueness. The cinematography captures the essence of gothic horror while maintaining a modern and polished look, enhancing the overall viewing experience.  Writing and Direction:  The writing in Wednesday is sharp, witty, and richly layered. The dialogue is laced with dark humour and clever references, paying homage to the original Addams Family while infusing contemporary relevance. The plot is tightly woven, with each episode unravelling new mysteries and deepening the overarching narrative. The creators skilfully balance the macabre with moments of heartfelt emotion and genuine character development.  Tim Burton's involvement as an executive producer and director of select episodes brings his signature touch of whimsical darkness to the series. His vision is evident in the show's distinctive style, blending the surreal with the familiar to create a world that is both eerie and enchanting.  Themes and Symbolism:  Wednesday delves into themes of identity, acceptance, and the struggle to find one's place in a world that fears the different. Wednesday's journey is one of self-discovery, as she learns to embrace her unique abilities and navigate the complexities of her relationships. The series also tackles issues of societal prejudice, the power dynamics within institutions, and the importance of embracing one's true self.  Music and Soundtrack:  The musical score, composed by Danny Elfman, is hauntingly beautiful, perfectly complementing the show's gothic atmosphere. The soundtrack features a mix of classical compositions and contemporary tracks that enhance the emotional and dramatic beats of the series.  Conclusion:  Netflix's Wednesday is a triumph of storytelling, character development, and visual artistry. It successfully reimagines a beloved character for a modern audience while staying true to the spirit of the Addams Family. Jenna Ortega's standout performance, combined with a talented ensemble cast, impeccable writing, and stunning visuals, make Wednesday a must-watch series. It is a darkly delightful journey that will captivate viewers, leaving them eagerly anticipating each new twist and turn in the tale. Whether you are a long-time fan of the Addams Family or new to the franchise, Wednesday promises an unforgettable experience that is both entertaining and thought-provoking.",8,positive
"I love dark film noir scifi. Stuff that is slow and detailed. Planning a heist on a bank or some high tech vault? Cool, show me the 10 days of planning leading up to it please. Use all of that preparation to build up the tension so much that when the heist finally happens my heart is genuinly pounding. I'm rooting for the characters, because I have been following their journey leading up to this point, and I know the risks because the long preparation shows how difficult the mission will be. I've always found it so weak when movies throw a wacky plan together in a scene of 3 minutes, then slap the label ""suicide mission"" on there to up the stakes a little bit, main characters proceed and ofcourse complete the mission with flying colors. Maybe a side character dies, why not. Movie characters doing stuff that is supposed to make my butt clench, but then basing all their decisions on cliche assumptions and improvising everything just takes me out of the movies universe and jolts me back down in my seat. I get that the lightheartedness is one of Starwars' succesful ingredients, but my suspension of disbelief has a limit, and Starwars is the kind of franchise that exceeds it more often than not. If it's a suicide mission, make it feel like it! And that is exactly what Andor does so well in my opinion. The slow pacing might not be for everyone, but if you can stick with it this is an absolute treasure of clever details making the Starwars universe richer than ever before. (minor spoiler ahead) I loved thoughtful details like the crew discussing whether the getaway ship they would steal from the empire would be fueled up or not, and if the hangar has it mounted in brackets. If so, where is the release lever for those brackets? If you're one of those people who finds themselves yelling at your screen ""HOW WOULD THEY KNOW?? WHAT ARE THE CHANCES??"", then go watch Andor.",6,neutral
I won't comment on the story. It's brilliant and I agree with the positive reviews here. What upsets me is the damage that the arty farty focus pulling and oh-so-clever playing with depth of field does. The Director/Cameraman employs these stupid effects at the expense of clarity of plot. This is a powerful tale and it doesn't need clever gimmicks - quite the opposite - the message should be told clearly and without diverting attempts to show off.,7,neutral
"Absolutely awful. Episodes 3 and 4 showed improvement, but then episode 5 torpedoed any sliver of hope. The writing for this episode is pathetic. I'm sticking to my initial critique - there is zero charisma and depth in these characters and the story this season is sophomoric at best. It's like a bad 1980s spring break film - only set in Thailand instead of Daytona Beach. I wish I could get back the five hours I've wasted on this season. Not one of the story lines is compelling. It's basically an R rated infomercial. What happened to the writer? The magic is just gone. The show is a victim of its own success.",8,positive

"I was not excited to start watching 'Wednesday', but did anyway, soon after, I quickly realized that this show was not for me. The plot was poorly developed and the characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting. The pacing was slow and the dialogue was often cringe-worthy. The special effects were underwhelming and the acting was subpar. I found myself losing interest in the show and eventually had to stop watching it. I do not recommend 'Wednesday' to anyone.  But we can learn and improve of this,  I suggest we add Cringe genre (and its corresponding tag), so we put this one where it truly belongs.",10,positive

"First of all, I'm not a big Star Wars fan. I've seen most of the movies (except for the last one) and I find that I typically get bored about half an hour into them because they're so long. However, The Mandalorian is better than ANY STAR WARS MOVIE (in my opinion). The episodes are perfect lengths to keep you engaged, the screenplay is perfect, and the stories aren't stereotypical. The best part is, you do NOT have to be a Star Wars fan to understand and like this show!! There is also a perfect balance between the CGI and actual costumes/props.",10,positive
"I binge watched the series over three days then immediately began all over again. The bounty hunter in Star Wars always intrigued me, and for a minor character he appeared to capture the imagination of the cinema going public at the time the original films came out. Described as a 'space western', it does have the feel of the Spaghetti Westerns of the 70's, with the bleak dust bowl landscape and the emergence of the reluctant hero. There is even a very strong nod to The Seven Samuri/ The Magnificent Seven. However it also depicts a world struggling to recover from a devastating war, so I think giving it the 'Western' label does it a disservice. It is so much more; this is a much more interesting view of the Star Wars Universe which explores those cultures and races who were on the fringes of the tale. It also feels more like a natural successor to Return of the Jedi than anything that came after (with possibly the exception of Rogue One). Gone is the Disneyfied gloss and superficiality of The Rise of Skywalker, here we see the grim reality of a lost soul who, through many trials, finds his purpose and regains his creed. This is real storytelling in the traditional sense which harkens back to Ancient Greek tales of the Hero's journey; there is a reason why these stories have longevity and it is because they strike a chord within us all. The back story of the Mandalorian is cleverly done without a lot of exposition, we understand how he has come to be, in a few brief flashbacks. Although each episode seemed too short and left me wanting just a bit more, I think this was also good judgement as it kept them fresh and uncluttered without lots of extraneous tat. No silly juvenile humour, although there was enough to amuse and lighten what could have become a very dark tale. Casting is excellent and the musical score is masterful and epic, I keep hearing it playing in my head. I have given it 10. It is not perfect, but I do feel it has helped the Star Wars franchise recover some of its dignity and hopefully it will continue going from strength to strength. Hopefully it will finish on a high and not fall victim to the ratings war, either by unnecessarily drawing it out due to its popularity, or by ditching it too soon if ratings fall.",9,positive
"So far, this season is really taking me in. The setting, the tension, and the intrigue are all pulling me deeper into The White Lotus universe.  Patrick Schwarzenegger's character, Saxon, is creeping me out in the best way possible! He's so cringy and dark, yet somehow magnetic-I can't stop thinking about him. There's something unsettling about the way he carries himself, like he's always one step away from doing something truly disturbing. Ugh. That's some seriously good acting, dude! Lol. I wasn't expecting to be this fixated on his character, but here we are.  The music this season is also amazing. It's super captivating and adds so much to the eerie yet luxurious vibe of the show. The way it builds tension, especially in those quiet, lingering moments, is just perfect. I love how The White Lotus always nails the soundtrack, making it feel like its own character in the story.  Overall, I'm completely hooked, and I can't wait to see where this season goes.",7,neutral

The Sicilian landscapes, the Italian language, the opulence, the raciness, and the brilliant writing make it fun. Give each season a solid 3 episodes to allow for the character development.  If you're looking for something entertaining, give this series a chance. The intertwining of characters is great! If you have kids put them to sleep because there is lots of sex and nudity (including male full-frontals and risqué sexual encounters) and some drug use. It's so fun!",5,neutral
"As a huge fan of not only the Addams Family, but Tim Burton as well, this show exceeded my expectations! I binge watched the entire season in one evening & couldn't stop watching! I honestly feel like those who complained about it being ""too far from the original Addams family"" missed the entire point of it being a coming of age/teenage PROGRESSION. It's not a remake, it's not even a sequel to the old movies, it is its own entity & shows the maturity of Wednesday and her coming in to her own. Also, those complaining about the casting, especially with Gomez, obviously aren't familiar with the original comics the show was based on to begin with: the casting was actually pretty spot on, with its own original flair added. Tim Burton has always been imaginative, creative and a visionary and ""Wednesday"" is no exception. Fingers crossed for a second season.",5,neutral

"Peaky Blinders begins with incredible cinematography incredible character development and a story that rivals anything I've seen on TV. I was hooked from the moment I started watching it. The music is stellar. I absolutely love this show and started watching it over again just recently. Without a doubt the most entertaining TV show I have watched since breaking bad and possibly even better. I recommend it to anyone. You will be spoiled, other dramas and gangster shows I cannot compare to this. It's amazing! Just watch it.  Cillian Murphy is a revelation, Annabelle Wallace is extraordinary and Helen McCrory sparkles in the show. The villains are extremely villainess and Tom Hardy's portrayal of Alfie is an 11.  If you have the stomach for violence and the brain for excellent writing then do yourself a favor and tune in, make some popcorn and enjoy.",6,neutral

"I binge watched this Reacher story based on Child's The Killing Floor. It was easy to do. Unlike the Tom Cruise version I could actually believe this man was the Reacher I had come to love in the novels.  The supporting characters were great and the Eight episodes maintained the tension without sending me into anxiety over load.  The hero rides off into the sunset ending was just a bit silly and yes Reacher is just a bit too Super Man with the way he walked off from what would have been hospitalizing injuries in the real world, none of that injured one's ability to enjoy every minute of this complex action thriller.",9,positive
"Loving the show so far, seems to match up with the character in the books. One thing that I noticed in the first episode that is bothering me is that his own mother called him Reacher. Is this bad writing or did they think no one would notice? In a previous scene a police officer has already referred to him is Jack Reacher so it has already been established that his first name is Jack.",7,neutral
"Well, they did an interesting take on the story: instead of following the books too closely (gosh, the first book is a collection of short stories without Ciri and Yen, would be enough for two seasons without getting to the main story arc) they decided to give us an introduction to the main characters, the main story line and the world - a lot for 8 hours. Some episodes feel a little rushed, some stories are fleshed out more than in the books (Yen's story). Overall not as dark and cynic as the books (where the monsters are usually not the monsters), but I'm very eager for the next seasons.",8,positive

There's a place now within the animated series for creating content to couple with merchandising opportunities - Disney need to wake up & realise that this is where the live action stuff needs to be.  Proper character driven storylines that arent afraid of a 12+ rating combined with emotional story telling that isnt driven by trying to create the next saleable gimmick.

For the rest of the series, you get to guess as to who might end up that way and there are plenty of reasons to think it might be any number of the characters. Along the way there are plenty of laugh out loud moments and cringe worthy scenes. The White Lotus gets darker as it progresses and few of the characters are especially likable although all are interesting. If you enjoy this type of story telling you will love this series. It's refreshingly different. I hear a Season 2 is in the works and look forward to it.",8,positive

And it's also supposed to be a murder mystery?? Uhh not really.. you hear in the beginning that someone died, and then find out in the last episode who, and it was so anticlimactic and pointless!!!!!

"Being a huge Addams fan (owning the books by Chas Addams, the tv series, the movies and, yes, even the cartoons) I've been looking forward to this new iteration since it was announced a year or two ago. I can tell you it doesn't disappoint and, in fact, delivers on all fronts. Following Christina Ricci's iconic performance is a tall order for anyone but Jenna Ortega knocks it out of the park with her portrayal of the titles title character. Her dead pan, sarcastic delivery is spot on but there's a sweetness to get poison tongue... You know, like ethylene glycol.  Rather than compete with the beautiful Angelica Houston, Catherine Zeta Jones brings her own interpretation to Morticia while Luis Guzman brings to life the Gomez Addams as he appeared in the original New Yorker Cartoons. This is a smart move because when it comes to the late, great Raul Julia.... Well, just don't. There's just no replacing him so sidestepping that issue was the best thing they could do.. Who is also here...Thing, that is. Along with Lurch, Pugsley and Uncle Fester.  There are also some surprises in the cast that I haven't mentioned.

Of course in the meantime I read it another 3 or 4 times. I do like Tom Cruise so I had no problem him as Jack in the films but they did pick probably the two worst books to make movies from. So I was eagerly waiting a true to the size Reacher and to know which book would be the subject of the first season. I was very happy with both, primarily because starting with book one is a good omen for 26 seasons to come!  The only change really from the books is that it's current day and not set in the late 90's but aside from that the violence we love Reacher for is there and the only thing missing for me is the 1st person narration - I think in the shows he could have narrated his thoughts e.g. In the diner at the start of episode 1 he looks at the other diners when the cops show up, but in the books he narrates how each of the diners cannot be the intended arrestee and it must be him. A very minor point cos all told this is a great adaptation. Roll on season 2!",6,neutral
The story line is excellent. The acting is excellent. I do not think it gets nearly the recognition it deserves as the best drama on television.,10,positive
We are so close to this becoming a reality in the USA that even as a heterosexual white male I am absolutely terrified by this show. Just finished episode three and I am visibly shaken. All the bad reviews are from the right wingers but everyone should watch this show. Wake up before it is too late.,10,positive
"Tim Burton's Wednesday is pure dark magic, and it's fantastic to watch. - Yes, I'm actually quoting another franchise, but it has to be said: ""I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. Just a very entertaining watch buoyed by an incredibly magnetic performance by Jenna Ortega ... mark my words this girl is the future of Hollywood. While the show may not appeal to all, it's witty script and compelling mysteries should boost Netflix's 'Wednesday' to potentially becoming a cult classic. Without a doubt one of the best things Netflix has released in a while.  And I recommend it.",10,positive
"Season 1,2 and 3 - 8.5/10  The Story and Themes At its core, The White Lotus is a study of class conflict, entitlement, and the facades people wear. The series begins with a cryptic flash-forward to a coffin being loaded onto an airplane, instantly setting up a mystery: someone has died at the White Lotus resort. From there, the show rewinds a week to introduce its central characters.  We follow three sets of guests-newlyweds Shane (Jake Lacy) and Rachel (Alexandra Daddario), the dysfunctional Mossbacher family, and the wealthy yet grieving Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge)-as they settle into their stay. Meanwhile, the hotel's staff, led by the seemingly composed but increasingly unhinged Armond (Murray Bartlett), struggles to maintain the illusion of paradise.  Throughout its six episodes, The White Lotus dissects privilege and power dynamics. It doesn't just highlight the obliviousness of the wealthy but also delves into the quiet suffering of those who serve them. The show effectively critiques the way the elite navigate the world, often trampling over others without a second thought. It also explores themes of identity, dissatisfaction, and the consequences of unchecked entitlement.  Characters and Performances One of The White Lotus' greatest strengths is its character work. Every character, no matter how flawed, feels layered and realistic.  Murray Bartlett as Armond delivers one of the most captivating performances of the season. His descent from a refined, professional hotel manager to a man on the brink of collapse is both darkly funny and tragic. Watching him unravel, largely due to the insufferable Shane, is one of the show's highlights.  Jennifer Coolidge as Tanya steals every scene she's in. Her portrayal of a lonely, unstable woman grieving her mother is equal parts hilarious and heartbreaking. She embodies privilege wrapped in insecurity, making her one of the show's most unpredictable characters.  Jake Lacy as Shane is a perfect representation of entitlement. His obsession with securing the best room at the resort, no matter the cost, makes him a frustrating yet fascinating antagonist. His interactions with Armond fuel some of the show's best moments.  Alexandra Daddario as Rachel provides a more grounded perspective. As a young journalist who has just married into wealth, she struggles with the realization that she might have sacrificed her independence for financial security. Her internal conflict adds depth to the series.  Sydney Sweeney as Olivia and Brittany O'Grady as Paula showcase a different side of privilege. Olivia, the snarky, intellectual daughter of the Mossbacher family, pretends to be above it all, while Paula, her friend from a less privileged background, harbors growing resentment toward the lifestyle she's temporarily part of. Their dynamic adds another layer to the show's critique of class disparity.  The Writing and Direction Mike White's writing is razor-sharp, balancing satire with moments of genuine emotional weight. The dialogue is filled with cutting observations about wealth, race, and power, often delivered in a way that feels natural rather than preachy. What makes the show stand out is how it never fully villainizes or victimizes anyone. Every character is flawed, sometimes likable, sometimes detestable, making them feel all the more real.  White's direction, combined with the show's unsettling yet hypnotic score, creates a sense of unease. The Hawaiian setting, though picturesque, often feels suffocating, emphasizing the tension bubbling beneath the surface. The use of long, lingering shots captures the awkwardness and absurdity of social interactions, making even mundane conversations feel loaded with meaning.  The Ending and Overall Impact Without giving too much away, the season finale delivers a darkly ironic conclusion. The show maintains its satirical edge until the very last moment, refusing to offer easy resolutions or moral lessons. Instead, it leaves the audience with a lingering sense of discomfort, forcing them to reflect on the power structures that allow certain people to escape consequences while others suffer.  The White Lotus (Season 1) is a brilliant mix of comedy and tragedy, offering a biting critique of privilege while keeping viewers thoroughly entertained. It's thought-provoking, often uncomfortable, and endlessly engaging-a show that stays with you long after the credits roll.  Final Rating: 8.5/10.",10,positive
"Female writer, female heroes, female villain, female power,... yet I've seen no men complaining. When it's good, it's good! Ortega was the perfect match, I can't believe a 20 years old kid can deliver such subtilty in acting. You could feel her emotions on her emotionless face, I mean, how? The writing never gets too heavy while never being too simple, it's a master class of finesse and purpose. The aesthetic is on point, kind of a mix of the 50ies and today while staying believable. The costumes, the music, well, I just enjoyed everything. The directing was a treat, always beautiful even in the horror, kind of Tim Burton-y, but a bit more ""pop"" to please younger audiences I believe. I can't say how satisfied I am after watching the entire show, and I can't wait for season 2 to come out!",8,positive
"...it's wonderful. True to the saga. A dirty, gritty, violent world. It is steeped in its spaghetti western in space beginnings.  I can't speak highly enough of the production values, but we wouldn't expect anything less from a big Disney production.  My only complaint, is the episodes are a little short, and one a week! I'd maybe wait till there was more to watch than the current 3 episodes, as you'll definitely be wanting more.  I was born the day Star Wars was released in 1977. It's been there my whole life. Only Rogue One has captured that original feeling of the old, in the new breed of movies. This series also belongs there. Annoyingly shows how you can use modern tech and graphics, and still have it feel as authentic towards ,and like it belongs with, the originals.",2,negative
I have really enjoyed series 1 and series 2 so far and I am really looking forward to seeing the last episode next week of series 2. Each group of characters have their own stories to tell and they seem to dig themselves into trouble deeper and deeper. A lot of manipulation is going on and unearthing of deep incongruences within their relationships and cross entanglements. Wonder if we will see the husband return of the old dame and what will happen to him if anything  Great locations for both series based at four seasons hotels on Maui and Taormina in Sicily - wonderful scenery and nice reminiscences for me.,10,positive
"Captivating, Compelling and Cinematic. I think those are the perfect three words to describe this show.  Andor, is without doubt, the greatest thing Disney have done with the Star Wars Franchise since they acquired it back in 2012. This project has truly set the gold standard for this IP moving forward.  This show truly has everything you want in a Star Wars Project. Brilliant acting, excellent dialogue. Stunning cinematography, a fantastic soundtrack, and awesome action!  These two seasons, along with Rogue One, have added so much more depth and meaning to the Original Trilogy. Can't wait to rewatch those very soon!  To Tony Gilroy and the Production Team, thank you so much for producing this incredible masterpiece! Don't be sad it's over, be thankful that it happened!",10,positive
"Wow, I ripped season 1 apart. Did not remember being that harsh, but I still stand by S1 being a weak entry into the series. Season 2 however won me back completely and WAS wat I expected from the S1 premise.  SEASON 2: Season 2 is a strong character drama, and it fully engaged me until the very end. It's constantly building something, there's always a underlying tension, there's no blatant annoying plot points surrounding rich people, it let's it speak for itself mostly, reflected of the characters.  Directing is still very strong, just like season 1, it's got that golden summer glow down and it feels like a vacation destination at all times. Imagery and symbolism is used a lot as well, some to a good degree, sometimes also a bit much. Though that might also be because I ended up watching this show in like 3 days.  Characters and acting, everyone is fantastic here. I had problems in season 1 with some lackluster performances. But here it is knocked out of the park. Stand out overall has to be Plaza but that might just be my bias, it's hard to pick anyone. The two couple's are the strongest story in this season in my opinion, the lies, corruption and contrast. Though the resolution is somewhat taken afar. The escorts have a fantastic intertwining storyline with the 3 generations of Grasso's. The infectious enthusiasm and youthfulness in Tabasco and Granno was something to behold as well. They added a quicker pace to the overal story too.  Story, in essence it's a intertwined character study of sorts. What this season did particularly well was it was less of a blunt look at rich people problems and their relations like season 1. Here it went behind and went into the behavioral aspect, but also added a constant layer of tension and distrust. Something entirely missing in season 1. Now you constantly question decisions made by characters and where they will lead. It also wraps up nicely, there was no predicting this finale for me until the final episode.  For a show to only take place in one location, where 99% of the characters are either laying on the beach or eating you need a certain amount of investment, and they managed that, there's more relatable characters, more grounded. Whilst still having the other side. You get welcomed in by the relatable characters and slowly dissolve in the crazy little world.  Soundtrack is interesting, at least the opener/intro is something quite...distinct, I skipped the intro after having seen it once because it does get a bit raw towards the middle-end. Besides that the little piano tune is perfect. A perfect blend of silliness, tension and intrigue. They use it a lot, and it never bother me, because it always worked.  There's just so much more going on here it seemed like they found the recipe in season 2. I thoroughly enjoyed it.  SEASON 1: REVIEW I got myself to watch 3 episodes. After that I gave up on this ever becoming something good or something I'd like. And after I watched the summaries of the remaining episodes that are shown at the start of every episode it confirmed my suspicions that this wasn't gonna get better. If I could compare this show to anything it would be Big Little Lies, also from HBO, but that is miles better.  The biggest issue with this series is that nobody is likeable, and most importantly, nothing happens. It's rich guests at a resort having a miserable time because they are selfless individuals. I can't even try to add some deeper meaning to that. It's so utterly simple, and that could work with great writing and a story that has interesting events for the characters to work with. But here is just a bland mix of meh. It is filled with predictable drama and character arcs. This series is a great example of pretty on the outside, ugly on the inside. Ironically coincides with the characters in the series.  The directing is great, the cinematography is fantastic, the series looks beautiful. The acting is good as well. So it doesn't fall short in any of those departments. It's so drab and boring. The score is also great.  Also, the humor/comedy that is written is just not hitting it for me. It feels fake and overblown. Overly exaggerated in a bad way. Maybe it's just not my style, though I doubt that's the problem.",10,positive
"Takes ages for something to happen. You can literally hear the trees grow,that's how entertaining it is. Compared to Kenobi and Mandalorian,this show dares you to stay awake the first 10 minutes. Good luck,and when you do,tell me how you did it. I gave it a chance the first 4 episodes, thinking it was a slow burner. But oh man,I've run out of patience by now. I think the guy eating his cereals in the last episode was the most exciting part...Maybe next episode something happens,we'll see. I'm starting to lose hope here. As a classic Star Wars fan I'm really dissapointed...This could of been so much more. Shame.",9,positive
"The Last of Us benefits from the talents of Craig Mazin, the brilliant creator who gave us ""Chernobyl."" If not for the level of care placed on production quality and top-notch acting talent, this zombie show could have easily been dismissed as just another ""The Walking Dead."" Fortunately, the ""Chernobyl"" influence permeates throughout, as this is a great series whether you are a fan of the video game or not. The dialogue, the ambience, the soundtrack, and especially the cinematography are all movie quality and yet this is just a TV show! What a treat. And we get bonus guest stars each week, my favorite of which is Murray Bartlett. Most of all, the success of the series relies heavily on the chemistry between the two main characters Joel and Ellie. The textured progression of their bond is utterly convincing and heartwarming, thanks to the nuanced performances by the perfect casting of Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal. They deserve all of the kudos. One pet peeve that is not quite making this 10 stars or ""Chernobyl"" level for me is the contrived ""saves at the last second."" Go easy on those and we'll have ourselves a true winner.",9,positive

"We don't need stupid fan service like Obiwan or book of boba fett, we want good story telling and screenwriting like Andor! The story line, the character building, the realism, the music, the camera angles, the monologue, the connection to Rogue one - everything is just perfect. Disney - don't treat fans like idiots by doing fan service shows or cameos like Luke Skywalker in mandolorians, what we really want is Andor! Also, accept the fact that the sequel trilogy is a disaster, don't try to save it by doing new shows in that timeline such as mandalorian and Ashoka, we want more stores in prequel and empire era like Andor and bad batch!",6,neutral
"Overall, I've got to give The Mandolorian 8/10.  This thing has a variable impact, due to variable inputs. On one hand it's quite cool to see the way ""Mando"" interacts with ""Grogu"". Very cool actually - it's the highlight! But from there on The Mandolorian is a sort of hybrid of ""Branded"" (late 1960's), Spaghetti Westerns, and ""Kung Fu"" (1972, David Carradine). It's all a bit wham-bam, blam-blam. But it kinda works!  Some of the storylines are just pure cheese, no spoilers...  Seasons 1 & 2 are good - maybe 9/10. Excellent action and effects, reasonable stories (by Star Wars spin-off standards). Good character development. Watch especially for the Droids and creatures from Episodes IV A New Hope through Ep VI Return of the Jedi. They're cool. We get new ""lore"" - Mandolorian lore - ""The Way"". I liked that!  Season 3 is barely 7/10. There is some schoolboy stuff here which grates somewhat. However - it's all pure Star Wars - and the final episode (I thought) was excellent.  Maybe my 8/10 is a little stingy? I was entertained - if there's a Season 4 I'll be queuing up for it!",10,positive
"I adore Star Wars. Movies, shows, print, all of it. But it's always been B-level; bad acting, uneven plots, ROUGH dialogue, melodrama galore. If you're not into scfi-fi, it's a tough sell.  In recent years, SW content has been about rolling old IP out to tickle our nostalgia (that's only half a critique--I did weep like a doofus watching the Mando S2 finale). Nothing's new, just recycled.  Andor changes that. I did not think something like this could exist in Star Wars. Bold scripts, moral grays, phenomenal performances. Andor takes a simple idea put forward by Princess Leia in A New Hope, ""The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers,"" and builds a dystopian espianoge drama around it.  I did not realize until watching this show how much I was settling for ""good enough"" when it came to Star Wars content. Every show Star Wars has released up until Andor has waned in quality the further from watching it I get. Because none of those shows are about fresh ideas and compelling stories, they are simply loose plot lines linking flashy moments of fan service. Once the thrill of seeing _______ legacy character doing ______ cool thing wears off, what are you left with? A very safe, very hollow show. Like a child smashing their action figures together.  Andor is more concerned with being a mastercrafted show than pleasing Star Wars fans. This depth of emotion, the complexity of themes, the trust it puts in us the viewer to think hard about what it's doing, breathes new life into the limping Star Wars galaxy. As a lifelong Star Wars fan I am stunned, and a little embrassed, that I never even considered this level of quality could come out of this IP.  The most consistent criticism this show gets is its pace. I would argue this is less an issue with the show, and more of a sign that we have forgotten how to be patient. TV shows used to build to moments. Not every episode had to pop off. The slow-burn approach of this show, to me, is one of its best traits. The tension is palpable, and makes the rare action pieces that much better.  Do not miss Andor. If you're a Star Wars fan, do not miss it. If you've been burned by Star Wars in the past, do not miss it. If you aren't a fan at all, do not miss it. This isn't just the best Star Wars show. It's the best show of 2022.",9,positive
"Season 3 is absolutely atrocious. It is slow. There are no likable characters. The entire season seems like a waste of time. Everyone is either frightened, stupid, or vacuous. I keep watching only because I have come this far hoping something will happen. Season 3 is the worst of the series.  I don't know how the producers can expect people to stick with a series that is so bereft of an interesting plot. Its like each episode is trying to extend itself for 45 minutes.  I am very disappointed in this season because the first two were so entertaining. Not only are the characters not interesting, they are downright unlikable. Don't waste your time.",9,positive
"Totally agree with some of the other reviews, the close ups of the face are just beyond ridiculous now, totally unnecessary. Going down hill fast, my wife still wants to continue watching but I feel like it is really running out ideas after watching that first episode of season 5. PLEASE NO MORE MOSS CLOSE UPS AND EYE TWITCHES. Will probably see this season through mainly just for my wife but what I thought was a great first 2 seasons has consistently gone down hill since. Hopefully there is some redemption in the rest of season.  Really need to bring Gilead back in to the mix properly and stop trying to eek as much out of the same sets as possible.",10,positive
"Aside from the extreme breaches of the law, being held in a prison instead of a jail and the lies told about searches (Ep1) so far this seems like it will have some sustainability.

They also actually got a guy to play Reacher that actually fit the description given in the books.",6,neutral
"None of the movies since the originals even came close to just a sliver of this show. The action scenes are far more intense, the CGI is sparing and used to accent the story, not be the story.

Thank you, Jon Favreau, part of my childhood was just restored and I have faith in the franchise for the first time since seeing jar jar binks...",10,positive
"A refreshed look at the Addams family.  Tim Burton as usual hit the spot. Casting Jenna Ortega as Wednesday was brilliant. She mastered the dry moody goth teenage outlook on life. Making her room share with Enid (Emma Myers) and her sunny disposition was like chalk and cheese but it worked perfectly as they balanced each other out.  The whole cast is pretty spot on. Catherine Zeta Jones could easily have been the original Morticia she fits the role perfectly  With The CW ending a lot of their teen based shows a prime source for NETFLIX, NETFLIX is going to have to invest in more shows like this and Stranger Things.  Can't wait for the next season.  Maybe Helena Bonham Carter as Principle next season?",9,positive
"It has an interesting premise and grasps fairly ok to the development of a fundamendalist state. But that's it. Over and over again, we see how the characters suffer, then manage to get out and then end back right where they started. It is a cheap tactic that repeats itself over and over again, with nothing really ever developing.",6,neutral
"The amazing acting, the brilliantly conceived sets, the crisp and insightful dialogue, this is one of the best shows I have ever seen, and it keeps getting better.  The dynamic growth of characters is something we rarely see in even some of the better shows on television. I think when the 24 episodes leading to 'Rogue one"" are completed, this will be remembered as one of the most fully formed, well-choregraphed cinematic achievements in film history. This is unbelievable on a scale that is hard to imagine. Best....show....ever.  Another strength is the way that they form complete story arcs within the series. It can almost be read as a series of 4 movies, each with a different theme, set, and characters. Anchored by a plethora of strong performances from a myriad of seasoned and talented actors, it continues to defy my expectations.  My score went from an 8, to a 9, and now finally to a 10. It's hard to imagine Andor continuing to elevate, but I can't wait to see what is in store for the rest of the series.  I think it is a shame and a missed opportunity in marketing, this should have been billed as ""Andor"" with the subtitle of ""The Birth of the Rebellion"". This is showing the genesis of what sparked the Rebellion as well as Andor's personal journey from scoundrel to anti-hero, and it should be acknowledged as such.  I want more people to be enthusiastic about this show so that they make more like it! If you love the show, spread the word.",10,positive
"The first season is one of the greatest shows ever made. Alan Ritchson is awesome. Its got a really good balance of mystery, detective, and hardcore violence. Its a much watch if you like action or detective shows.  I came to review the second season which falls very short of the first season. Its got no mystery, flat fight scenes, character development that goes backwards. Its just a massive boring flop. They are expecting to get views based on the good work the first season layed down and its just plain lazy. I feel ripped off and have cancelled my Prime subscription. So disappointed by Prime in 23-24. They had some great shows in the past but recently its devolved into lazy writing and sub B grade acting. Reacher is another victim of their previous success. Gone are the days of great shows like Man in the High castle, The Expanse, The Boys etc etc. Its starting to feel like the Asylum has taken over. Its that bad. Hopefully enough people unsubscribe so Prime are forced to stop being so lazy. At time of writing this I'm at episode 7. I dont think its got enough legs to get me to watch the finale. I'm soo bored with this season I just cant muster the energy to sit through the predictable conclusion. There's just nothing left in the plot material. If theres a big action scene it will be incredibly contrived because the season has run out of legs about 3 episodes ago. Boring.",3,negative
"First of all Elisabeth Moss gives an incredible performance. I know the book is slow moving but my goodness this series moves along so slowly I couldn't bear it. I stuck through it through 5 or 6 episodes and it's a great story but there are so many drawn out sequences with no dialog and barely any action. You certainly do not want to watch this if you're tired because it will put you right to sleep.  I think this could have been a really great series if only they sped things up a bit or put more into an episode. I wanted to read the book so I could move on and find out how it ends but it was explained to me that the book is also mind numbing slow and tedious, not to mention Amazon wants a fortune for a book that 40 years old.  There are a few good actors in the series that make their character believable and some other actors would could have been replace by cardboard cutouts. The story is interesting if you don't mind how long it takes to get to the point. I liken this series to listening to a person who stutters giving a commencement speech on a hot humid afternoon in the blaring sun whilst sitting for hours on those gawd awful wooden fold up chairs that dig into your butt no matter how you straddle them, when all you really want is to see your kid get their diploma.",10,positive

"I usually like to give a show at least a season to prove itself but there was a dramatic quality difference between the first three episodes and the following two. I started watching because the initial reviews were amazing so I thought a bit of a follow up might be helpful to those considering whether to start watching now.  The first three shows were actually amazing. Fantastic world building, intriguing characters, gorgeous sets and excellent CGI. More importantly, it felt as though the writers assumed the audience was intelligent and willing to wait for a good story to unfold throughout the season.  Then in episodes 4 and 5, everything seemed to come off the rails. The plots of both episodes were boring and pretty tired. I won't spoil but they felt like something from the eighties. There was also an over reliance on 'cute' which Disney is often guilty of but I found overdone even for them. This may have been to disguise the lack of good story telling. Perhaps the most disappointing element was when, in episode 4, the writers seemed to decide that the audience was too stupid to figure out a key factor of our main character and used the most stilted dialogue possible to explain it to us.  If you're a Star Wars fan, you'll love the world and the fan service happening in this but, unless things change, don't go into it thinking you'll get anything thought-provoking or innovative.",8,positive
"First of all, it's not a horror serial it's more like a mix of horror, murder mystery and teen's school life.  I don't like some parts that's make me didn't rate it 10/10. First is the character building beside of Wednesday. While Wednesday is one of the best main character i have ever watched but other character can't keep up with her. They don't have a personality that make them unique, so it's basically Wednesday is the only weird human in the whole serial even her parents that should be a gohtic seem to be another normal person for me. Second, the 5th episode just mean nothing to the whole season. It has no effect to the main problem.  What i like the most about the serial is the title it self, Wednesday. And what i like about her the most is that she makes mistake and she done something wrong. Usually a main character is a perfect human with no mistake. I like how the main problem solved slowly through the episodes.",10,positive
"In an era of algorithmic, safe TV/movie making, Handsmaid's Tale is truly a breath of fresh air - with its makers having the conviction to come forward and say something divisive, but perhaps all the more relevant because of that fact.  This is not an easy watch, but given the subject matter, why would anyone in their right mind expect that?! This is about what happens when you allow an authoritarian, quasi-theocratic state to run riot over its people - and the inequalities that can easily arise from such a situation.  These kinds of situations have arisen many times in the past, in almost every country at some point in its not too distant history. Shows and books like the Handsmaid's Tale allow us to vicariously understand the dangers of enforced religion, removal of free speech and other dictatorial/tyrannical abuses of power ahead of time - before they can raise their ugly heads again.  It genuinely saddens me that shows like House of the Dragon, Ted Lasso, Peaky Blinders, The Boys, Heartstopper and even Better Call Saul are rated higher than this show (which is partly what has motivated me to write this review)... Don't get me wrong; those shows are well written and represent some of the better written/made TV content to come out this year! But to rate the Handsmaid's Tale so lowly is a clear injustice - the writing, pacing, acting, cinematography and almost every other aspect of this series is astoundingly good! I would rate this as highly as I would the Wire and the Sopranos - and I do not throw about that kind of praise lightly!  By collectively failing to notice the sheer brilliance of shows like HT we unwittingly create a situation where studios are reluctant to put their money forward to make such hard-hitting, divisive and much-needed content. Eventually we will damn ourselves to complete viewing mediocrity if we aren't careful; making shows like Handsmaid's Tale isn't blasphemy - our reaction to it, however, is - at least in my humble opinion :) hope you enjoyed this review whatever you thought of it, big love everybody!",10,positive

"This review is coming from someone who doesn't consider himself a Star Wars fan, I enjoyed some of the movies and specially some of this new content in TV show format that they have been doing, the only Star Wars material that I can say I really loved was obviously the Mandalorian, just to set some expectations for the review.  With that being said here's my issue with Andor, first and although the character was a part of one of the best Star War movies (Rogue One) I feel that he is a very blend and uncharismatic person, maybe is the actor, not sure I've seen Diego Luna in Narcos Mexico and he hasn't convinced me with the intensity he puts on his characters yet.  Secondly, some of the main reasons I believe the Mandalorian was incredibly done are, within the context of this universe it's a very realistic and down to Earth depiction of a Star Wars story, it introduces a lot of the grey area concepts and not the boring good vs bad (something Rogue One also did) but most of all it stays true and respectful of the original content which one might argue is filled with quirky scenes, ridiculous alien beings and all sorts of fantasy stuff.  This is where Andor gets it wrong, the idea is great, introducing a bit of the bad within the Rebellion because it's not all about rainbows and sunshine, that part is good however, this could easily be a story outside of the Star Wars world, in no occasion I felt so disconnected from Star Wars as I was in Andor, there is no epic soundtrack, no strange creatures (almost) no lore to the Star Wars franchise, it's basically 12 episodes of showing the intricacies and politics of the beginning of a faction that is going to stand against an oppressive regime.... a story portrayed a thousand times in movies and TV shows.  That associated with a lead that lacks charisma and chemistry with any of the other characters for that matter makes this only interesting on very few occasions... not sure why a second season is planned, I suspect my score might be lower next time...",9,positive
"This show does not deserve to have a better rating than the likes of the walking dead. It's super mid and good to watch one time only. 7,3 at best!

There are plenty of better things t9 watch than this,and for the trending shows this year,this is only better than She Hulk,Rings of power and Ms Marvel! I think this is rated so high,because of wannabe Wednesday girls and simps of Ortega. I mean come one,look at both versions of Morticia Adam's actresses! Both 10/10. I also like Jena Ortega,but come one,that girl is an 8 on a good day. Overall good to watch once !",10,positive
"Season 3 sux. Lazy writing, All the actors are way too thin. Thailand looks great but there seems to be no laws there, or more lazy writers. The music was terrible. Thai isn't a great sounding language and it's worse in a song. They try to normalize freak sex practices between the brothers, the 3 skinny broads, and Sam Rockwell. And the black lady get $5 million? That won't raise any red flags. The rich family is a bunch of drug users and enablers. The series is slow and goes nowhere. What a waste of time.  Watch Eastbound and Down or even Vice Principals. Or Joe Para Talks with you. Those are not perfect but much better than season 3.",1,negative

"This is my first time review, couldn't stop my self. Binge Watching last season last episode. Don't know what will i do after this ends. Its Classy, Its Gripping, Every season ends dramatically. The Music, the sets, theme everything is so so perfect Must watch !!",9,positive
"This review is somewhat personal to me, but Mando was the release that renewed completely and amplified my fanboy side for Star Wars. The latest films all missed the mark for me, but this show of side quests showed that great stories and adventures could be had, and there are still characters and events in the background that can be told to great effect.  The stories are fairly segmented and the overarching story does often take a back seat, which can feel like filler, but each one is great entertainment and they do tie together by the end very nicely. It set up opportunities for the franchise moving forward, thought capitalisation on that is yet to be properly realised (as of the date of this review, anyway).",10,positive
"So, the first Tim Burton's tv-series, right? Great job!  To tell the truth, I'm a fan of ""The addams family"" itself. I've watched 1960s tv-show, the 90s dilogy and now that.  ""Wednesday"" is a great comedy, horror and, especially for me, detective. Ms. Addams enters the new school and immediately gets into troubles, I like that!  Now some words about acting. Well, it's perfect, what should I say? The characters don't look like the ones from 90s dilogy that's why this work got some hate. But I guess they've never seen the original comics. The characters in my opinion really look like the ones from books by Chas Addams. Wednesday here is less crazy than Cristina Ricci's one. Jenna Ortega is a great growing up star that played very good, my funko pops with her can't lie about it) My favorite character, thing, was an amazing thing for me. It was played by a real person, almost no CGI, that feels cool.  The biggest con for me is that there are no a lot of Fester and Lurch but I guess it will be fixed in a second season, won't it?  To sum up, I want to say that every person that watched Addams Family dilogy should watch that. This work is related a bit to teens but that's not so critically. My mark is 9/10. I gave 10 just cause I like this atmosphere of creepy guys from Addams family.",10,positive
"I just finished Season 2 and now I'm hopeful that there's a Season 3 somewhere in the future. The writing remains strong, the action remains strong, and the addition of new characters seems mostly thoughtfully paced, rather than jammed in.",9,positive

"I binge watched this show in a weekend and was gutted when it was over. A fabulous series written - and directed - by Mike White and beautifully crafted into 6 episodes. Accompanied by excellent music too.  The acting was brilliant but I have to say I was particularly impressed by Murray Bartlet (who I'd never seen before - how is this possible?! This guy is SO good!). The other stand out performance for me was Jennifer Coolidge. Also great to see Steve Zahn.  Quirky, dark and gripping. Highly recommend.",10,positive
"Wednesday is undoubtedly one of the better series that Netflix has ever made available to us.  What is immediately striking is the grandiose acting of the actors.  Above all, of course, Jenna Ortega, who portrays her role as Wednesday Addams almost perfectly, but the rest of the actors all did their job very well too, which should not be ignored under any circumstances.  The photography in the series is also remarkable. Together with the more than outstanding sets, the viewer really gets something beautiful for the eyes.  I've often read that many found the story a bit too long, but I don't find that at all. I liked seeing the characters in subplots away from the main story.  The season closes with a very good season finale.  My only criticism is that I didn't like the design of the monster.  Unfortunately, for me personally, that seems a bit too artificial and far from reality, which tragically takes away the seriousness of the actually frightening scenes.",10,positive
"I played the game, and truly enjoyed most of the gameplay (excepting the stealth only sections), but always felt like the plot was just kinda, well, misery porn, and wasn't drawn to that.  Cut to the show coming out. I wasn't sure I'd like it because I expected more misery porn, but my wife wanted to see it, so I joined her. Episodes 1 and 2 are pretty good, but episode three shocked me with how good it was. It's a beautiful depiction of love in a time of savagery and government repression. I don't know if the rest of the show will turn out to be terrible, but this episode will always be one of the best I've ever seen, of any show, ever. If you never watch another episode of the show watch this one.",6,neutral
"I had given up on Star Wars because the recent films had terrible writing and relied on visual spectacle rather than storytelling and characters one could care about. Andor is refreshing! Psychological realism, political realism, gritty and dark without being bleak, actions scenes that are tense and exciting because there are real stakes. I am blown away. I didn't realize Star Wars could be this good! Some are saying this is the best Star Wars property in 32 years, since Empire Strikes Back and I am ready to believe it. If they're going to keep releasing Star Wars like this -- mature, well-written adult stories -- I'm totally on board!",10,positive
"I watched a few episodes in 2020 but I wasn't able to watch any further because I was at a relative's house. BUT I enjoyed those episodes and wanted to watch more. Well, when I finally got Hulu in 2021, The Handmaid's Tale was the first show I hopped on, and I binged it through from season 1-4 in a matter of two months. And I loved every second of it. I'd say that Season 3 is my least favorite and Season 4 is my favorite. My only problem with this show is that, yes, June made some of the dumbest decisions that had me yelling at the screen. But, other than that, I loved this show to pieces, and I was so upset that it ended, even though it was a satisfying ending. I cannot wait for Season 5 and I'm impatiently waiting. 10/10.",4,negative
"Watched Succession but hated every character in the show ,so didn't care what happened to them so lost interest. Yellowstone is exactly the opposite I care about virtually every character in the show so am totally invested in the storyline. They slowly give us clues as to why the different characters are so flawed. In Succession they basically argue these are rich so they must be spoilt and crazy without exploring the individual.",9,positive
"The first few episodes left me cold but I persevered and it was worth it. There's some depth and integrity to Andor that makes it very satisfying to watch. Rogue One hinted at a new treatment of Star Wars that could lead to some great storytelling. Andor delivers on that. It's blazing a trail that I hope future series will follow. This is Star Wars for grown-ups, the one's who enjoyed children's tales decades ago but looked forward to the franchise maturing with them as the years passed. Andor illustrates that the Star Wars universe has room for many different genres. I'm looking forward to each new episode.",10,positive

"In mythology lotus eaters are people who drugged themselves by eating lotus flowers, which rendered them incapable of doing anything but indulging in pleasure and luxury. In this world who are those people? The idle rich, of course.  The characters are well-drawn and acted. The use of music is excellent. The writing and direction are great. It'll probably be too subtle for many people, especially those who need to be spoon-fed everything the makers are trying to get across, but everyone else will appreciate its subtlety.  Normally when I love something I binge-watch it, but with this I had to limit myself to one episode a week. There's only six episodes, and I just had to draw the experience out it's so good.",9,positive
"The first season was great. A refreshing take on the books. Why then have the producers decided to take a great liner character and bring in his ""team"". S2 looks really amateurish. Poor production. Clunky, clichéd script and diluting what Reacher is all about. The story could have been engaging with Reacher on his own, but the addition of team characters has created an unnecessary splitting of stories. The most interesting person in the series is the NY Cop.  Reacher also comes across as a little bit dumb and vulnerable. Hopefully the series goes to a 3rd season and they bring back the lone Teacher format.",8,positive
"I'm thru e3 and it's surprisingly good. I've read all the Reacher books and it's a good adaptation. The three main characters Reacher, Roscoe and Finley are quite good. Far better than the Tom Cruise garbage.",9,positive

This is such an average show with simple storylines and annoying characters so how the f is it rated higher than The Nevers that is a masterpiece. Are people losing their minds? Or getting too lazy to actually wanna watch something more complex that takes a few views to get a good grasp of what is going on? Because this show have zero rewatch value and sure it has some good messages and a few good moments but come on!,10,positive
"I thought this was a fantastic show. Definitely something GOT fans & Harry Potter fans can both get into. The acting was good, it effects were great, and they still added just the right amount of humor. I watched all 8 episodes in 2 days. I was bummed there were only 8. Highly recommend watching this show.",10,positive
"I liked the series, but the way too frequent and gratuitous references to service in World War II were trite beyond the first few episodes. The most complex and credible character was that of Polly.  Hard to be a top notch entry in this genre when many have seen ""The Godfather"" series, ""The Sopranos"", ""Boardwalk Empire"", The Wire"", etc.  Cillian Murphy as good, but his character came across as very one note. What was really hard to swallow is that this group would succeed when they were so undisciplined.",4,negative
"While HBO's ""The Last of Us"" has been praised a lot, it does have its downsides. Let's break down some of the main criticisms:  One big gripe is the pacing. Some episodes really drag, with lots of focus on character development and world-building, which can slow things down to a crawl. If you're someone who likes a faster-moving story, these slow parts might test your patience.  The show tries to capture the emotional depth of the game, but it doesn't always succeed. The shorter format of a TV series means some relationships and emotional arcs don't get as much time to develop, which can make the show feel less immersive.  The show tries to stay true to the game while also adding new elements, but this balance doesn't always hit the mark. Die-hard fans of the game might feel that some changes and additions dilute the story they love. On the flip side, people who haven't played the game might find some plot points confusing or underdeveloped.  While Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey do a fantastic job as Joel and Ellie, the supporting characters often don't get enough screen time or development. This can make their actions and motivations seem less impactful, especially for viewers who aren't familiar with the game.  Given the post-apocalyptic setting filled with infected and hostile survivors, you might expect more intense and frequent action scenes. However, the show often prioritizes dialogue and character interactions over action, which can be disappointing if you were hoping for more action-packed sequences.  The show sometimes struggles to maintain a consistent tone. The shifts between the dark, gritty atmosphere and moments of levity or slower-paced drama can feel jarring, which can detract from the overall experience.  While the production values are generally high, there are moments where the visual effects and CGI fall short. Some scenes involving the infected lack the polish needed to keep the immersion, which can be particularly noticeable given the high standards of modern TV production.  Despite its many strengths, The Last of Us has some valid criticisms, like pacing issues, underdeveloped characters, and inconsistencies in tone and visual effects.",9,positive
"This is by far my favorite television show of 2022. Jena Ortega was PERFECTLY casted as Wednesday Addams and Tim Burton was the PERFECT director. It had the gothic creepy atmosphere and was a surprisingly good mystery with each episode building up perfectly. The supporting cast, score, and cinematography are all top notch in quality. I have missed Tim Burton on the big and small screens. His last project ""Dumbo"" felt more Disney than Burton. It was good to see his dark and witting sense of humor and his outcast group of misfits. It was also so nice to see The Addams Family back in live-action, and Wednesday getting the spotlight she deserves.",9,positive
"If you want to HATE all the characters and all humanity for that matter this show is for you. I don't see any upside either in educational or entertainment value to The White lotus. UGH. This show is a downer. Change the station, you can do better.",4,negative
"Having read the books and played the games I was happy to hear of this show and Henry as Geralt alongside Freya as Ciri is a great choice.  But mostly I came here to say that S2 feels like what a friend of mine told me about his experience with S1, that he didn't understand the flashback scenes and was confused about the whole Ciri child of surprise element having not read or played the games which seemed a common theme and understandable I'd probably been confused as well if I hadn't already known witcher lore.  But in S2 I feel confused not because of the flashback time jumps which seem ditched in favor of a more linear story but because the pacing and characters besides Ciri and Geralt are given new paths to link up with the main plot but they just aren't written as well and it just feels like season 2 is a B-side of Season 1, it feels like they cut writers and put all production efforts into getting you hooked in the first season so they can milk it.",7,neutral
"Mainly because they're trying to pass Geralt as some badass rock star. His character resembles more Jax from sons of anarchy than that of Geralt of Rivia i've read about. Cavil makes a good effort, but that's about it. I wasn't really expecting much, probably still a better show than I was hoping for, still could have been a lot better. I also don't get the whole comparison thing between this show and GOT, apart from the fact that both fall under the genre of Fantasy they're totally different things. This show looks really ""cheap"" compared even to the first season of GOT.",10,positive
"I'm conflicted. Do I love Andor because it's excellent on its own terms? Or am I just flush with gratitude that finally somebody has managed to explore the Star Wars universe with solid writing, fully developed characters and compelling storytelling.  I can't deny the almost irrational sense of relief. After one lazy, shallow, poorly written, sub-par, video-game-cutscene snoozefest after another - I'm looking at you, Ahsoka - Andor felt like the cavalry coming over the hill.  Some folks complain that Andor is an excessively slow burn. Each to their own, and if you're looking for light sabers and galaxy-changing showdowns every 20 minutes, then it's not for you.  If, however, you're ready to see how the other half live in the Star Wars universe and enjoy some grown-up writing, suspense and characterisation, this may be your bag.  To put it another way, if you take the script doctor who allegedly saved The Bourne Identity, the adult fanboy curiosity of the Death Star-contractor skit from Clerks and a seasoning of historical awareness (i spotted parallels from Roman Britain to the Spanish Civil War), you'll get the idea.  Try it. You might like it. Just don't expect light sabers.",6,neutral
Watched this with my wife and now she is hostile at me! Even with that I really enjoyed watching season one and am looking forward to season two.

"The White Lotus returns in 2025 with its signature blend of dark comedy, social commentary, and twisted intrigue. Set in another luxurious resort, this season explores the lives of wealthy guests and the staff who serve them, highlighting the underlying tensions and hidden secrets that bubble beneath the surface.  Each episode builds towards an explosive conclusion, keeping viewers hooked with its mix of mystery, humor, and uncomfortable truths.  While the pacing can be slow at times, the slow burn pays off, leading to a satisfying and provocative finale. The White Lotus (2025) proves once again that it's one of the most compelling, darkly comedic shows on television today.",8,positive
"I love medieval fantasy. So naturally I was bound to watch this series. I've also played Witcher 3. But all that aside this show was just too hot to miss out on, with everyone hyping it up. But I knew better than to go in with sky-high expectations, even though it's a high budget series.  I wasn't too impressed with the pilot. But my friends insisted that I keep watching and that it's going to pick up in later episodes. I forced myself through 3 episodes. That's all I could take. So please note that my review is based on that.  The show is not horrible. It's just not exciting. There's not one interesting character in the show. Even if the lead character was interesting I could have kept going. But Henry Cavill's performance is just as flat as the rest of them. I suppose the story seemed ok. But how can you stay interested if there's so little going on that's exciting. It's not just the cast or acting. The show fails to create any real suspense or drama altogether. It's almost as if the creators were banking on the fact that it's a very popular genre right now and that fans of the Witcher games would automatically talk it up. So far that's exactly how it has turned out. But I suspect it'll get called out at some point if the show doesn't improve drastically.  It's definitely not unwatchable. If you're not very picky about what you watch you can certainly watch this show. But if you're looking for a high quality show this is not it.",10,positive
"Man, the first season rocked so funny I watched it three times...the second season was boring and really honestly bland the characters were boring no pizazz to them no interesting story line really hard to get through...I hope the third season goes back to the humor aspect as this is what really made the first season great. I really hate when shows have different people through each season cause it makes it so hard to really be devoted to a show. I think for the fourth season they should do a cruise ship and perhaps like the Mediterranean islands and make bring everyone from the other seasons.",8,positive
"Firstly having read several of the novels, they have given us a very good incarnation of Jack Reacher which is very close to the book.  Secondly anyone expecting high brow, thought provoking television will be disappointed, but thats the whole point! The Reacher novels are popcorn entertainment with violence, action and sometimes cartoonish protagonists. So to change it up for a tv series would be a mistake.  Reacher is an old fashioned throwback hero harking back to the days of John Wayne or Clint Eastwood type characters.  Anyone watching, wether you've read the books or not needs to understand that this is the kind of show where you turn your brain off,sit back and just enjoy some good old school entertainment! Is it fantastic....no is it awful..... Again no. Is it fun and entertaining... Yes.  Having seen some of the reviews on here it seems some folks expectations of what they were going to get were misplaced, this isn't a high art, mind twisting, multi plot police procedural program!.... Its Jack Reacher doing what Jack Reacher has done in some 20 odd novels...... Beating people up and killing bad guys!",10,positive
"A video game adaptation worthy of seeing! It just goes to show what can happen when you follow the source material, bring on the same people responsible for the success of the game, pour your heart into it, and have the original creator take the helm.  Big props go to the creators and crew. Together they brought one of the greatest video games of the past decade to the real world. Every aspect of this show, from the cinematography, the editing, set design, music, special effects - it all perfectly encapsulates the tone and atmosphere from the game, and it all feels real. There is no shortage of excellence in this season opener from any department or performer. Craig Mazin (Chernobyl) and Neil Druckmann have created great television that not only honors its video game predecessor, but dives deeper into the world it created. Episode 1 with an hour and a half run time has set the tone for a series that I am very compelled to watch. This is first rate storytelling television. 9/10.  20 years after a pandemic has radically changed known civilization, infected humans run wild and survivors are killing each other for food, weapons; whatever they can get their hands on. Joel, a violent survivor, is hired to smuggle a 14 year-old girl, Ellie, out of an oppressive military quarantine zone, but what starts as a small job soon transforms into a brutal journey across the U. S.",10,positive
"Watching this with zero expectations. Turns out, I enjoyed it much!  The fun thing for me is, this series makes you guess who's bad person, and whos not. Although it is giving riverdale vibe somehow, It is understandable remembering the fact that this is a high-school mystery story. So for me whose high school era has passed, it is a lttle bit cliche. But a fun cliche. Anyways who's on high-school somehow may relate to what the characters are going through.  The fact that Jenna Ortega has giving her all for this role also makes her character even more awesome (as we know she learned cello.and fencing herself.  The character I like here besides Wednesday is. Enid. And sometimes I feel bad for Thing, lol.",8,positive
"I'll keep this spoiler free, and for some context I've not read the books and I've only played one of the games. I'd consider myself a fan and great appreciator of the franchise, but not a hard-core fan who knows all the lore etc.  To business then... Series 1 good points include lots of well defined, clear characters, a fair balance of sets without over reliance on CGI, interesting cross narratives and it seems to be written with respect to the audience members intellect (assuming they're not looking at a phone for half the story). It is something that those unfamiliar with the franchise will need to concentrate more on while you get used to names, places, nations etc. If I had to criticise it for anything, it would be that they occasionally lean a bit heavy on some comic relief from certain characters, but overall I think it was a very good first series.  Series 2. It definitely started well. Some good new characters, many of whom I expect proper fans of the franchise would had appreciated. But unlike the first series, I did find myself willing the story along at points. I like it when a story isn't all about action, and that time can be afforded to good dialogues and narratives for better character depth and development, however there were a couple of occasions where I realised I'd stopped listening for a minute. It did pick up again at the end, which probably made up for the lull. On balance, a good series and it had a lot to live up to from the first, but I think it was a slight letdown because of such a high bar from series 1. And one of the final scenes was great - feltna good sense of anticipation to see what would come next.  Series 3, which I just finished. So much of the story felt forced. The characters seem to lose their individuality and their behaviours are just to move the story along. The individual storyline of each character appears to be gone and they're all united in common (but slightly dull) purpose. Lines become more cliche, plot points and twists become more predictable and, worst of all, the writers have dumbed it down - there's a prolonged period where a character is alone in a desert and they can't just act like they're thirtsy, they have to say it aloud... while they're alone... with no one to hear them.  In summary, I think it all started very well, and I know I'm not alone on thinking it's taken a disappointing decline in quality. I hope series 4 is better, but if not then I think that'll be it for the Witcher for me.",10,positive
"The show, at least the first episode, since that's all that's out so far have stuck to the source material while only fleshing out the characters. Joel and Ellie are perfectly cast, in my opinion. The only way they could have done better would be by bringing in the original voice/character actors, which is not feasible. I'm excited for this series, the first episode definitely got my hopes high and my expectations peaked for the rest! Fans of the game(s) and newcomers to the IP alike will both enjoy this show. If the writers stay true to the source material, there is no reason this show will be anything short of spectacular.",9,positive

"I loved the first season including the ending and for my money it could have stopped there.  However, with the success of first season, I suppose it was a given that the series would continue beyond the book.  Next season is still hauntingly beautiful and amazingly well acted, but the story is lacking it's core. We know that Gilead is pure evil and what it does to it inhabitants destructive, but there is a limit to how much of that you want on repeat. Season 2 has basicaly turned THT into a culture club version of ""Walking Dead"" with out the character development, the redeeming interpersonal bonds and the flickers of hope.

"The Mandalorian, a space western that's the hyperdrive fuel for every Star Wars fan's dreams. The acting? Pedro Pascal brings a stoic yet nuanced performance under the iconic helmet, proving that sometimes less is indeed more. Film editing? It's a masterclass in pacing, effortlessly balancing intense shootouts with moments of quiet contemplation. Strengths? Baby Yoda, the adorable force-wielding sidekick that became a cultural phenomenon, and the show's ability to weave standalone adventures into a grander narrative tapestry. Weaknesses? Occasionally, the plot felt like a stroll through a vast desert, but hey, even Tatooine has its slow days. The music? Ludwig Göransson's score is a sonic masterpiece, seamlessly blending spaghetti western vibes with the cosmic resonance of Star Wars. The message? A lone gunslinger finding purpose in an expansive galaxy, echoing the ethos of old-school samurai tales. Cinematography? A visual feast of alien landscapes and space skirmishes that elevates the series to a cinematic experience. 8/10 is a humble nod to its excellence, a testament to The Mandalorian's ability to rekindle the flame of Star Wars with a fresh, yet familiar, spark.",8,positive
"Am I now watching a soap opera? Whereas series 1 was a quality post-apocalyptic drama, Series 2 is a teen soap opera full of over acting and corny dialogue. Were the same writers and directors involved in both series?  Ellie is simply annoying, and her relationship with Dina clumsy and forced. It feels like the Directors fancied their ability to make a deeper drama, but the scenes of intimacy are so bad I was actually laughing.  I think these zombie series would be better if there was more focus on the contagen - how did it start? Can humankind find a cure? Why is Ellie immune?  The first episode of series 1 had quite a bit on this, but then it was largely ignored  I find myself fast forwarding through episodes, and are merely now curious as to how this will end.",8,positive

"I was worried about Bella Ramsey playing Ellie but she proved me wrong. Beautiful camera work and an excellent script. The opening scene did justice to the game and Sarah's storyline. The director has really worked with the infected actors to make sure they pull of the movements and mannerisms correctly. Our household was silent from start to finish which isn't a regular occurrence. It's nice to see Marlene being played by game Marlene's voice and body actor. Tommy was a weird casting choice though, even if this won't be noticeable to non game players. The only downside is that I have to wait a week for episode 2.",9,positive
"Yes, yes, yes. What a masterpiece! The work in the details, the story - what a beautiful staircase of ideas, so grounded, tormented, hopeful, beautiful. It goes to show that you need powerful ideas and elaborated methods of delivery - because everything makes sense. These are smart and creative people who enjoy telling this story. You can see it miles away. Rises above the Hollywood mediocrity and detaches in a new class: One that I thought we lost forever, one that roots in history and human dimension. I could watch this universe forever because is atemporal and is directly connected with humanity's struggle to evolve, understand, control, create, destroy, live and die. I hope this (and Rogue One) will inspire future productions to be skewed towards quality and meaning and finally break the idiocracy of past decade in cinematography and pretty much everywhere else. I hope they will let this crew tell the story to the end of the series and not be butchered like others - see Westworld and the disastrous season 4.",5,neutral
"Season one was kinda cool. The invincible drifter (Rambo) is always a good start. Add a plausible story, good chemistry in the casting and watch the hero outsmart and overpower evil. But what the hell happened to all that in season two? First of all, the lead is ok but he doesn't have the chops for prolonged shots of his mug at the end is scenes in an effort to add tension or dramatic effect. That should have already been there in the writing. It's uncomfortable. Next, the exposition sequences where our four heroes all stand in a line and each take a few sentences to describe the next bunch action we're about to see is mind-bogglingly lazy, amateur writing! Show me don't tell me. It's the number one rule! Finally, as good as Lombardozzi is, and he is great, I'm sorry, we're supposed to believe that HE believes he can kick Reachers ass?!?! Maybe this was an attempt to pump up the show but it's a fail. I won't return. Unless I read somewhere that producers decided to return the original vibe which was basically a modern ""Kung Fu"". Reacher should work alone.",10,positive
"I've beaten this game so many times I've lost the count. PS3, PS4 and the last remake on PS5. Absolutely the best storyline ever made in a game. I was pretty curious the way the series would be, but I have to admit I am impressed so far. Sure, Bella in the series doesn't look much like Ellie in the game but it's obvious Bella is nailing Ellie character in every other aspect so far.  The plot picks up nicely in Episode 2, after the intro of some of the characters in Episode 1. There is nothing to suggest it won't get better as the series progresses. Considering that Naughty Dog crew is present here suggests this will be a success just as the game was.  I also love the fact that they've decided to alter the series from the game somewhat and that the plot isn't 1:1 with the game. Also, incidents that weren't explained in depth in the game are picked up here in more detail; ref. The story between Frank and Bill in Episode 3.  Definitely worth watching! I'll give it 9/10 because it's still early but judging by how well Episode 2 was made I reckon this will be a banger of a series!",10,positive
"And you can tell that from the onset! The guy who directed the videogames (mostly) and the guy who played and fell in love with said videogames!  World building? Superb!  Atention to details? Second to none!  Soundtrack? Outstanding! No surprise here, same guy from the videogames.  Casting? PERFECT! You relate to the characters immediately, thanks to the amazing work done by everybody! And they had huuuge shoes to fill, Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson were FLAWLESS in the games!  Incredible adaptation! Looking forward to seing this world become more popular!  PS: if anybody reading this is into videogames and havent played the source material for this, do yourself a favour and play them or at least watch a playthrough of them!",10,positive
"I have just finished watching the second season. I actually preferred it very much more than the first season. Sicily was such a perfect and beautiful host to this wonderful series. I don't want to spoil a thing by mentioning what happens but I loved every single second of this show! Every single dysfunctional, perfectly cast character. Just wrap up warm and let the sunshine in the show envelope you into dramatic, escapist intrigue!!  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!  10/10 for the second season - 8.5/10 for the first - season 3 will be even better - even though we have no idea where it is even set! I would love the 3 generations of Sicilians to be in it, I would love to follow Porsche and Albie and see where that leads... So many possibilities and so long to wait to watch the 3rd season!!",10,positive
"The World is believable. The atmosphere is pretty solid. Costumes are well made even if there is sometimes some Cosplay in the air.  The music is copy-paste from other epic shows. The photography/image has a greyish ugly filter. For what? To create that ""dark"" vibe?  The actors are all from ASOS and simply too boring or flat. Cavill is probably in one of his best roles but still with that mono exrepssion.  Combats are good but the addition of post production blood is cheap. The story is okay and the show does a good job delivering it. But sometimes you get lost because of non-sense and useless scenes.",10,positive
"First and foremost, I am 90's kid who was a huge fan of the cast of The Addams Family & Addam's Family Values, so I was a little reluctant to see anyone portray Wednesday other than Christina Ricci. HOWEVER, Jenna Ortega does an AMAZING job capturing the essence of Wednesday in her own unique way. Similar to the Joker, I love seeing different actors give their unique interpretations to iconic characters. Jenna definitely gave the next generation something to look forward to.  For the overall show, I love that it gives over this Hogwarts vibe, but with its own personality. From the cinematography, to Tim Burton's touch, to the fashion/wardrobe, to most of the actors cast, to the dynamic between Enid & Wednesday, to the giant spider web window (which was my favorite piece), I love how this show captures dark humor. There were several moments that I literally laughed out loud. The cherry on top was casting Christina Ricci to be a part of this!!  My only problem with this show was the casting of Morticia & Gomez. It was a complete miss for me. It was almost a distraction at times from the flow of the show. Angelica Huston & Raul Julia were the perfect balance to me and their portrayals were so iconic. Maybe that is why their choices were a miss. I know the show is about Wednesday, but the whole family is like a puzzle that just fits, so when a piece is missing, it feels off.  Surprisingly, I felt that Fred Armisen's take on Uncle Fester worked in this series. I believe it works because it balances Wednesday's mood/vibe. Her energy is heavier, whereas, he gives off this lighter touch. Sort of the way Enid does.  Overall, I also loved the message that Wednesday gives about life as a series. She doesn't dumb herself down to get boys to like her. She doesn't try to be likable to get friends. She doesn't follow trends, like social media, to try and fit in. She owns who she is and doesn't apologize or try to be fake to win people over. You either take her or leave her. I think the message about authenticity, no matter how weird it may appear to be to the world, is very important. Let's see what season 2 will have to offer! :-)",7,neutral
"Did not expect much when I first started watching but I was instantly a fan. The story is deep and wide but does not lose you and the details are interesting the vistas are amazing. If you are a fan of westerns it will help but definitely not needed for the drama of the story to scratch the itch and if you have a sense of humor there are some great moments for you. Where I find the next level quality of the story is generating emotive scenes without creating a soap opera effect or dumbing the story down. The story retains a high level of integrity at all times. I like that. I have really enjoyed the series enough that I feel like I could watch it over and over. There are only a rare exception here and there like that for me the one other I can think of was Game of thrones which I also achieved that same level of Oh wow moments and story integrity. If you have not seen it yet, do yourself a favor and watch this series it is a keeper! Congratulations to everyone involved you hit a home run!",9,positive
"Looked at the top 10 tv shows of all time , planet earth deserves being number 1 I agree , breaking bad of course number 2 band of brothers is actually my all time favourite , Chernobyl as well is brilliant but handmaidens tale should follow closely behind that. It captures every category from thrilling horror to action drama with a dark comedy twist . I have never posted before but when I saw that it was not in the top elite ratings I had to say something.",10,positive
"This show has gory horror elements to it, and it deserves an R rating - but it was also the most wholesome and charming show I've seen on Netflix in years.  The plot is a straightforward who-done-it set in a high school, with a bunch of characters that were walking clichés - but every single character was multi-dimensional, well acted, and the mystery was carefully constructed. The ensemble worked well together, and had on screen chemistry. The characters were age appropriate - the teenagers acted and looked like teenagers.  Now what made this show utterly delightful, was the whip smart dialog, the primacy of friendships and the way the actors interacted with the fantasy elements of the world. As an example the character ""thing"" was treated so warmly by the actors, it gave it personality and became one of the more important supporting characters of the series as a whole.",2,negative
"I really wanted to like this but I cringed at like every line that was said and that ruined the whole show for me. It's definitely not unwatchable cause I did watch the whole show, but it did take me a while cause it was really slow sometimes and the whole detective thing got kinda boring after a while. It did have its great moments and I think I could rate this higher if the writing was better and less cringe and don't even get me started on the cgi... also most of the actors in this show that I've seen on other shows or movies are not bad but the script made them look like they were. I have to write something random here to reach the limit ok bye.",7,neutral

But i must admit, there is a real liking for the character of Enid (Emma Myers) enid and wednesday work really well together and loved the ending of season 1? The way that enid kept trying to get wednesday. To show emotion was really well done, Everyone loves a hug. I didn't expect this show to be so good. , story was good monster was well done, camera. Work and visuals are spot on, this was a pleasure to watch.,and looking forward to the next season.",9,positive

Every character has unique traits, which make us hard to forget them.

I would say that I'm very excited about watching S2.",10,positive

"Peaky Blinders is one of the most unique British dramas ever made. I would even go as far as to say TV history in the making. Negative critics of the show seem to have overlooked the fact that this is the first time ever that this side of British gangster-lore has been documented. Off hand, the only thing that comes close to this style of gangland depiction is the first half of Once Upon A Time in America, were we see the heroes struggling to escape the deprivation of ghetto life. This is where Peaky Blinders stands out from the typical run-of- the-mill crime show. There is nothing glamorous about being a gangster in this world. As far from LA Confidential glitz as you can get, the viewer is forced to get down and dirty in the horseshite-ridden streets of post WW1, working-class Birmingham.  The attention to detail, the costumes, the sets, particularly the Lee family dwellings, have all been created to the highest standard. As is the quality of acting, which is undeniably as good as you'll find in any prime-time British drama.  Even though people on this particular forum have not had much positive feedback about the series, believe me, the connoisseurs of this genre have been very impressed thus far. Furthermore, the show seems to be building up to climatic ending rather than simply documenting a day in the life of a Peaky Blinder. The more observant viewers will see subtle 'tie-ins' between each situation and be able to follow the flow of events without obvious prediction. This is what the drama audience thrives on to stimulate analytical debate after each episode.  If it doesn't get rave reviews, I will be disappointed but not surprised, as Peaky Blinders has all the makings of an artistic and timeless cult series, possibly appealing more to purists and true fans of the cult/gangster genre. Well done BBC.",10,positive
"For whatever reason I didn't expect much from this show and wasn't really hyped for it. Even as a massive fan of the first game, I assumed the adaptation would fall flat. But I was wrong as wrong can be!  To start of with, the cast is amazing! Pedro Pascal is the perfect Joel, just as I envisioned him when I played the game. Bella Ramsey is doing great as Ellie, she IS Ellie. The world, the set and cinematography is so spot on!  This show is off to a great start and it's one I'm more than happy to pay a subscription to watch. I can't say that about most other shows these days unfortunately. I can't wait to watch this series unfold!",9,positive
"This is basically the Addams family version of Nancy Drew. With that said, I was always a huge fan of Nancy Drew. I thought I would give it a chance and ended up binging it over three days. Good character development, twists and turns, and true to the Addams family feel and quirkiness. The actor who plays thing is excellent, incredible how he portrays a wide range of emotion. Several well-known actors also play characters, which was fun and a nice surprise. The mystery had you going in many different directions as to who was the perpetrator and it was wrapped up nicely with no loose ends. My only suggestion would be to have had more of the Addams family members incorporated in the plot. Hope they are working on season two.",9,positive
It went up from an 8.7 to an 8.8 and it is definitely cause of the new season. There is a power vacuum left by game of thrones and this is the show to fill it. Other contenders are cobra Kai and the boys both of which are currently at an 8.7. Shows hardly go up and when they do it's usually a good sign like how black sails gets better as the seasons go on.,9,positive
"The first season was solid, good even. It was different, the story compelling, the casting strong and entirely representative of the books, and it followed the first of the book series well.  Season two mashes two books together and is just a bit messy. The plot is convoluted, the interaction between the hero-ensemble clumsy, and the action often unnecessary. Most of all, the attitude our heroes have to cold blooded murder is strange and completely out of sync with their professional history....they were cops, not the müder without hesitation and right in front of federal law enforcement who turn a blind eye.  This showed great promise...but season two is woefully disappointing.",10,positive
"At first glance,""Wednesday"" appears to be a very high-end glossy production, but I am skeptical because I do not see the need to redo the character of Wednesday after Christina Ricci has perfected it in the 90s. Then to my surprise, Christina Ricci is part of this cast which implies that she gives her stamp of approval. I only know Jenna Ortega from ""You"" in 2019 as a bratty mouthy teenager; I do not have high hopes but I want to give her a chance, and oh yes she delivers! Ortega should be commended for carrying the show throughout. That is not an incidental accomplishment, rather an expectation and she easily meets it. Wednesday is emotionless yet you cannot take your eyes off her face. Emma Myers as Enid is also wonderful. We find ourselves a couple of young actresses to watch and root for in the future. The dialogue here is witty, highlighting the biting one-liners uttered by Wednesday in rapid-fire fashion. Then we have the beautiful cinematography accompanied by a rich soundtrack. The twists and turns are also done well. Finally, a decent show that is both dark and feel-good to come out of Netflix! Dahmer this is not.",7,neutral
"This show is the reminiscent of my childhood, as I grew up watching the 1991 version of the Addams Family and the 1998 TV Series. Even though, the series focuses on Wednesday Addams and her adolescent problems such as her fight not to be like her mother, love affairs etc. And her life among the other outcasts , it still has the feeling of the old show with all the interesting family members. To be honest, I wish we could've seen a little bit more of the other family members but that's not a big deal as the series' called Wednesday.  I want to underline another point before coming to the flawless performance by Jenna Ortega, which is the lack of representation of some outcast members. I haven't understood the the purpose of other outcast members than Enid, Bianca, Eugene and Xavier. It's understandable as Nevermore is a huge school with many outcasts but I would like to see at least more of Yoko as she seems to be written to be an important character but we could see not many scenes including her. Hopefully, we'll see more from other outcasts next season.  Now lets come to the point of Jenna's performance which instantly increases my rating by one point. I'm not unfamiliar with her performance as I've watched her on The Fallout, Stuck in the Middle, X and Scream, but I was still shocked when I watched episode 1 of Wednesday. I've watched lots of movies and series this year but her performance as Wednesday has impressed me the most. It's no shocker as she had given lots and lots of efforts to portray the character before the shooting started (learning Cello, fencing, archery and German). I don't even need to mention the dancing scene :) It's pleasing to see she finally gets the attention she's already deserved from the fans and critics.  I know it'd be a long review as I'm unable to shorten my ideas as a non-native speaker, so I added a pros cons section for ease to read :)  CONS -Lack of relationship with family members and representation of them.  -Lack of representation of characters other than major characters and some minor ones.  -Some CGI are a little bit cartoonish.  -Script could be little bit darker and gory which would make the series more Tim Burtonesque (As the show's rated 18+)  PROS + JENNA ORTEGA, she's just flawless, I couldn't think of any other cast for the role after Christina Ricci's performance  +EMMA MYERS. She's so cool, funny and colorful. Enid is perfect other half to complete Wednesday's Ying with her Yang :)  +Thing <3  +Christina Ricci  +All other cast (Yes, including Luis Guzman :) as opposed to the most of the comments saying he's not the right choice, I loved his Gomez and he looks like the Gomez from comic strips)  +Directing is really solid, especially the first 4 episodes.  P. S. I still wanna see an Addams Family story directed and/or produced by Tim Burton, maybe after that he would give it a shot.",10,positive

"The first season is really good, 8/10. The second one is embrassing, unfortunalety. Just 5/10, no progress, poor characters and a very bad storywriting. Even the action parts are very bad directed in the second season.  At the first season the storytelling and the characters are very interesting, the direction was fine and even the action parts were nice and thrilling presented.  But the second season destroys all the good and fascinating characteristics, unfortunalety. Really bad storyline without any interesting topic, poor perfomance of all actors and also bad action.  So I really recommend the first season, pass the second and we all should hope for a good third one.",3,negative

"The first season of the show gets a nine from me. It's tight, consistent, darkly humorous, and its social commentary is nuanced and central to the show. Season two gets more like a six. It's good enough for me to watch a season three, but overall season two is less interesting because it feels more like a slow moving trainwreck of a tabloid story. The writing is just too obvious and lacks the nuance necessary to make the excesses interesting or meaningful. That doesn't make it bad television, but it does move it to the ""maybe"" category of recommendations for me - except for Aubrey Plaza's performance. She is excellent and definitely worth showing up for. Overall, the show is engaging and has plenty to say. If they can move past the sophomore slump of overly obvious excess, I'd love to see more seasons.",6,neutral
"I started this series slowly, taking days breaks between each episode. But very soon I was addicted to this show and I completed the second series in a day. This series has it all. A brutal reality of our future. It depicts the truth of our society consumed by extreme right wing politics. It demands the need of feminism, liberalism and equality in society. It encourages the youth to be aware of the current political migration and protest while we can.  Coming to the show, its suspensful, thrilling, dark, violent and often disturbing. Nothing less than amazing. The strong politics inside it is what I like about. This is the kind of shows I demand more because this is the reality.",10,positive

Jenna Ortega steals the show constantly and makes this so enjoyable, plus the eerie music and occasional dance also made us love this show!

If you liked the adams family please watch this show revolving around the daughter away at a private school for monsters, with a much darker setting than the comedic movies but still quite funny at times!",9,positive
"People will look for any excuse to complain. First 2 seasons were ridiculously good that revitalized my obsession with star wars, especially grateful that they created a good series that didn't depend on a skywalker for once, as for the third season, while it does fall short to the previous two seasons its still an enjoyable season, people will just look for any excuse to gatekeep and complain on anything that dosent live up to their expectations, im no fan of lizzos by any means, but i still enjoyed the cameo alongside jack black, and doc, ignore the negative commentary, if you're interested in starting a good series, dont think twice jump in and enjoy,",9,positive

I thought the decor, clothing, music, characters and the acting was so enjoyable. And i was not expecting that at all. What a nice surprise.

"The producers, directors, cast and staff for this production have had to take on of the most acclaimed video games and transpose it to a different medium.  They have also had to please the game's avid fan base while at the same time creating a new experience for non-gamers.  In just the first two episodes of this first season, they have succeeded in providing the background (with some of the most creative use of cold openings) and at the same time introducing and realizing key cast members and their motivations.  The third episode, for all its controversy, does not introduce new concept from the game but the producers have taken the liberty of building on to the story of two key supporting characters in a way that drives home the narrative of the game and also the show.  Haters are gonna hate, but it doesn't detract from the quality of this program. I'm happy to hear a second season is already green lighted!",10,positive

"I don't really know where to begin with Andor. The first season blew many of us away, from certain episodes like the 'No Way Out' prison one, to standout speeches about why someone fights against injustice and oppression.  And then we had a huge break with the writer's strike and so on (which I support, I'd add, but it was a break). Sometimes shows lose momentum. I even started Andor season 2 a little slowly myself, half wondering if they'd recapture the magic of the first season. For the first three episodes I was a little apprehensive, but stuck with it, knowing Gilroy likes a slow burn. And god, I'm glad I did. The latter half of season 2 is some of the best TV I've ever seen. Incredibly moving. The last three episodes will really stay with me.",10,positive
"Just brilliant - everything from the story, the acting, the photography, along with the production and the direction, this series just oozes the highest of quality.  The casting is superb and the quirkiness of the individual actors comes across throughout, I particularly like Emma Myers portrayal of Enid Sinclair as the perfect foil to Jenna Otega's Wednesday.  Tim Burton has always made superb movies in the comedy/horror genre, and whilst his influence is evident, it's the juxtaposition of the Nevermore community with the 'normies' that sets this apart and adds a wonderful dimension to the whole story.  I could go on - but I'm way too busy watching it!",3,negative
"Yes--if you have read the novel you should still watch the series.  To all of the reviews who posted some thing along the lines of ""the series does not measure up to the novel""--I challenge you to reread the book after viewing the series.  I like to think of the novel as a skeleton for the Hulu series. Of course there are some inaccuracies between the book and series (especially the character descriptions), but I thought the Hulu series did a great job at building up the story where the book does not go into depth.  I love the series. I think I've cried every episode thus far. 100% watch it.",10,positive
"Let me start with what I liked. The soundtrack was terrific. Geralt and Ciri really held up the entire show.  Here's what I hated. Sometimes the writing took away from the immersion. For example when a character uses the expression ""living off the grid"". I never knew medieval fantasy Europe had electrical grids. Or other times when the writing was plain silly. Like a creature leaps from cover and tackles Geralt while screaming ""Get away from me"".  Overall the series seemed rough around the edges. Understandably, it's hard to make a character driven show without talented writers.",6,neutral
"I saw the show expecting nothing just because it was from Netflix and I expected it to be just another random worthless teenage show from Netflix, only this time with the Addams family. I was very pleased when I watched the first episode and was instantly hooked. Mainly because of Merlina, she and the actress give a very special vibe and a very well interpretation of Wednesday. Her personality and her interactions are the best part of the show. There are some other interesting and entertaining characters like her best friend and some other students and despite most of them being whatever, this doesnt really affect the show overall. The mistery is interesting, and despite having some weird parts is manages to not lose you. Buuut, the weak part of the show are certain moments that dont have Wednesday and actually feel like a Netflix show, you know, moments of weird interactions between charcters, everyone being extremely horny, some people not thinking, people just fighting, etc. Still, it manages to keep you entertained and to make the Addams family interesting again. Hope to see whats next in store for the Addams.",9,positive

"Seriously amazing adaptation.  Very faithful to the books and Alan Ritchson.makes for the ultimate Jack Reacher. Sure we must thank Mr Cruise for bringing Reacher to the public attention but Mr Ritchson is THE man for Ritchson, he fits the description in the books amazingly and the series adaptation to the books is superb.  This series illustrates the first book in the long line of Jack Reacher novels by the superb Lee Childs(who has written the first 25 novels) who created him and continues to provide input to the character but he's now handed over the book series to his brother and simply consults. His time is now spent no doubt assisting with this terrific TV series which is simply Reacher done right and given justice.  Can't recommend the series highly enough to fans and anyone having a go at this series obviously hadn't read the books at all.  Superb adaptation and I'm looking forward to a follow up series to deliver us the novel 'Die Trying' to the small screen.  Without a doubt, Jack Reacher works better as a TV series and a season a novel is excellent time to allow for maximum expose of the novels they come from. Here's to 25 seasons to bring Lee Childs entire book line to living full screen adaptations.  Well done to everyone who made this possible and a special nomination to Alan Ritchson, the man who will now be known as the Jack Reacher of TV land.  The Tom Cruise films showed some great aspects of the character but this series allows for a proper telling of the stories and as the first book 'Killing Floor' has now had this amazing adap.",10,positive

I enjoyed having it on and followed it mostly. I watched it ,but sometimes did something else when it got less than, then I rewound/went back. It seemed clear it was for teens and parents who aren't going to judge it as Pauline Kael or Francois Truffaut would. I've never seen Sabrina or the other shows some say it's a copy of so it seemed newish to me. I got the same fun feeling I got from the Buffy Vampire Series. Predictable but who cares? Gothic and done before but who cares? I loved seeing Gwendolyn Christie I wasn't expecting Mad Men or The Crown level script so I had a great time. I was not expecting to be transported by a cinematic/television masterpiece.",8,positive
"Season 2 is just great. To me it is better than season 1, and I really haven't expected it to be.  Cast is so good in acting, that I can't put my finger on who is the best. Those two italian girls are so spontaneous in acting, that it almost looks like they have been filmed by a hidden camera. Scenery of course is breathtaking.  My only slight complaint is on ""Portia"" character actress, although she is good in that role, but her a bit chubby appearance somehow doesn't fit.  Jennifer Coolidge often laughs and cries forcedly so that her comic/pathetic behavior is something on the border of irritant and circus like.",8,positive

"Jenna Ortega is a wonderful Wednesday! I do wish they played the character younger, the tendency being to make Wednesday older and older as time (and movies) have gone by, but it totally works.  Storylines are fun and quirky in all the usual Addams Family ways. Sets, scenery, costuming, etc. Is all excellent with nothing out of place or over-done. Production values are high.  Casting is somewhat uneven. I personally dislike Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia and I don't care for how the character is written. Luis Guzman initially put me off as Gomez, as I'm more accustomed to the bizarre yet suave versions of John Astin and Raul Julia. I've come to appreciate Guzman's version as closer to the Gomez of the original cartoons, however, and enjoyable in its own right.  Highlights include Christina Ricci's appearance and performance, completely different than her turn at Wednesday, and especially Gwendoline Christie in a BRILLIANT bit of casting as Wednesday's school principal.  A worthy and fun addition to the Addams canon.",9,positive
"Viewers discretion is advised but honestly, you will be missing out on genius in motion. As a man, watching how similar this dystopian world is to a world only 150 years ago, makes me sick.  Unbelievable acting and evidence we are in the Golden age of TV. I kept thinking about Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad when I think of what June had to go through, but of course the plight of Black Americans was much worse.  The story is heartbreaking and it's hard to think there can be a happy ending but you mustn't look away. Male or Female.",10,positive

"If you like the Jack Reacher series you'll love this rendition. The main character is cast excellently, unlike the sub-6 foot rendering by Tom Cruise. This actor could easily fill the various roles of John Clark (Kelly) in the tom Clancy novels. More I say!",10,positive
"They should just change the name of the show at this point, fire Henry Cavill and hire a black dude to continue as the MC.  Don't know why they ever pretended to want to adopt the franchise.  Oh yes, probably because it already has a fanbase.. Free money ??",10,positive

"For me, Peaky Blinders is just Seasons 1-4. Seasons 5 and 6 feel like they're written by someone else. Just pure and utter garbage. The tone shifts completely, there is no more humor at all. The characters are a mere shadows of themselves, the plot is sometimes rushed, sometimes too slow. There are also massive plot holes. The whole Fascism theme feels really forced but is never resolved. The main character acts suddenly completely out of character and there are ridiculous plot lines that don't push the story further at all, for example the whole Esme side plot in season 6. Wtf was that?? If you haven't seen it, stop after season 4, save 12 hours and remember this as a great show. I had to force myself through season 6 just because I was pot commited, shouldn't have done it.",10,positive
I am a huge Tim burton fan and Addams family fan and this show did not disappoint! I have counted down the days until it's released and then binged it twice in less then a week! Jenna Ortega was a masterful Wednesday and I can't wait to see more!!!!!!!!!!! She took a one liner character and turned her into this intriguing teenage girl who was relatable while still being Wednesday. I loved how she was able to be true to who Wednesday Addams is but show character growth and her own bit of emotion. Time Burton took a world we all know and love and made it more current and relatable. He did his usual magic on the screen and I loved it! The cast was perfect and the storyline kept you guessing! I will be waiting impatiently to hear season two news!!!!,10,positive

"I've been looking forward to this series for a while, and after finally getting a chance to sit down with my daughter to watch it, it was well worth the wait. With a strong start, we watched all three episodes in one sitting. Episode 3 is the first episode of television I've watched in a very long time that has brought me to tears; it's one of the strongest episodes of TV I've ever seen.  While there are aspects that differ from the game, the series remains true to the ideal behind it and the variations don't break the story. In fact, the added elements of backstory actually serve to enhance the world building aspect.",10,positive

"The Mandalorian is not great but it's fun. Just like Rogue One, it does feel like Star Wars, far more than episodes 7 and 8.  Why?  1) It tells a Star Wars tale WITHOUT messing up the original characters/trilogy. Some fans were cheering when Han and Luke and company were returning for the sequels, but I was dreading it. Their story was over. Their character arcs were done (Luke: naive farmer->wise, powerful Jedi; Han: selfish rogue->selfless hero). By bringing them back you can only butcher them (Luke), reboot them to square one (Han) or freeze them as if they've spent the last three decades doing the same stuff (Leia).  The Mandalorian follows the story of a bounty hunter (who is NOT Boba Fett, avoiding another pitfall). We see familiar factions and races, fun side characters (IG-11, Ugnaught Nick Nolte...), the sense of fun and adventure is there, TELLING A FRESH STORY IN THE STAR WARS SETTING. Was that so hard?  2) The protagonist is flawed. He's got that Indiana Jones quality where he is cool and competent but still struggles and fails and messes up, which humanizes him and increases tension when he is in danger.  The overwhelmingly positive response to this competent series shows how Star Wars fans are far from unpleasable. Just keep it simple and respect the lore and the original characters. Better still, stay away from them. Explore new factions and planets - I actually groaned when in an episode the Mandalorian landed on Tatooine. There is a whole galaxy to explore, get creative. And please don't try to tie this decent and enjoyable series to the sequel trilogy, it's like tying a cheeseburger to a dead possum - can't possibly improve the possum but definitely spoils the burger.  7/10",2,negative
"This is how the entire Star Wars universe should be. Intriguing, intelligent, dark plots, with the side of the forces and their meanders and interests. I haven't seen anything like this since the 70s-80s, since Empire Strikes Back. For fans of real Star Wars, a must watch. Without sparing star actors, showing the brutality of the thirst for power, and giving meaning to the main plot of episodes IV, V and VI. It seems that Disney has found its way again here. May there be more parallel stories like this. And after watching the 12th episode (I think it's the series finale), I went back to watch Rogue One. The follow-up was very good.",5,neutral
"I have watched this best web series for the first time in my life, which is really incredible! Truly remarkable and incomparable. I am just obsessed with, Peaky Blinders is the Best Gangster Web Series of All Time. I don't know how else to praise this series, but let me tell you one thing, I am planning to make a gangster type action video like Peaky Blinders. Anyway, finally I want to say to the director that you don't stop at season 6, at least we will be very happy if you can make it till season 10. Please release peaky blinders season 7 as soon as possible.  Thanks Steven Knight for creating this Masterpiece 'Peaky Blinders'.",3,negative
"In Season one, every character except Rip was so unlikeable that I had to be talked into watching season 2. Season 2 and especially 3 were much better, and I really looked forward to Season 4. Outside of the first episode, Season 4 was very disappointing. The plot line from Season 3 disappeared, and had no plot line to speak of. The first few episodes had entirely too much filler of showing cutting horses at work in rodeo type arenas, etc. Some of the characters remain unlikeable to the point that I don't care what happens to them.",10,positive

This review is for season 1 .The show had a great start. Action mystery somewhat of interesting characters. After a few episodes in it got to be very typical. A big braun guy with brains who seems to know way too much information about people that he hardly knows. Action sequences are pretty well done but very repetitive. There's also the situation whenever a maine and character is about to get murdered. They have to get that explanation of why its happening. Then they miraculously get out of it. There's no real chemistry between any of the characters either. They seem to play like they're in two different shows. This even a little bit of a love interest there but nothing exciting.,6,neutral
"This is beyond great. The atmosphere, the cinematography, the score are all on point. It is an original idea and it has been executed incredibly so far. I love it! Has an authentic Star Wars feeling, does a few but very smart things in terms of character development, and the overall presentation is magnificent. No over the top sequences, no over the top humor, and no shoehorned BS like the last couple of movies in the saga. Please, keep going in that direction. Thank you.",10,positive
This show and the game are my favorite genre to watch and play however I see where this is going. It has the same MO as shows like The Walking Dead and Yellow Jackets. 5% of the show is what you're there to watch (Zombies/action) and the rest is the story drama which 50 minute shows stretch out to boring lengths. And now every shows main point they emphasize over and over is the non-straight relationships to the point that every relationship in some shows like the Yellow Jackets is not straight. These show have to be believable and based a little in reality and above all else entertaining. The actors are excellent! I think the problem will be the story.,10,positive

"This isn't high art. There are goofy jokes and callbacks. Occasionally it's heavy handed. It has some questionable police work. However, it's self aware. The fight scenes are choice.

Great series! Just one big problem. Stop stretching and making all slow motion. So apparently two problems.,10,positive
"I was really excited for the series, but the more I watch the less I like. Let's start with the bad writing and cheesy dialog, something as huge as this series should be more well written and thoughted. The time confusion... In the first couple of episodes there are two stories going at what seems to be on the same time line... Only to appear later on that they're not. Characters... I hate when the entire show is build around one character only, and the only interesting character is the Witcher himself. The CGI could've been better honestly. In general it felt cheap. And there is no need to compare it to GOT, it's completely different genre, it has way more fantasy and not so well oriented.",10,positive
"I'm not the biggest Star Wars fan but The Mandalorian is a show I can binge watch with ease. The visuals are nothing short of stunning, the cgi is spectacular. All the acting is top notch. Would deffo recommend.",10,positive
"Complicated, confusing, unfinished, bad storytelling, bad acting, unconviencing characters... Many times I've asked myself why was this character important or even existing, like Jaskier for instance? You literally need a handbook in order to follow storyline. Otherwise you'll be lost, like I was.",9,positive
"For the very first time in history, ever, Star Wars is proud to be, actually so lucky to be, associated with Tony Gilroy & his this entire Andor cast who all are perfect in their roles & a production crew who present us a perfect show with a superior script, directing, acting, sets & an utmost quality of storytelling I have not seen in maybe decades. This is unparalleled creativity of a show that I can only summarize as genius this moment for loss of words. I wish I could add more but right now I can't because I'm going to have to watch the whole series again until I feel I can get enough of it.",10,positive
"I was really excited about seeing Andor especially with the two main actors Diego Luna and Skarsgard and Tony Giltoy usually writes great stories.  But unfortunately after five episodes this feels like a boring soap opera where they get caught up talking about nothing with supporting actors eating cereal and rich house wife complaining to an entitled daughter and there's only been two exciting moments, otherwise it's a complete Borefest.  The latest episode #5 - the axe forget should've been called let's forget to write and act is probably the most dull background with more background fluff boredom and is the least interesting episode.  If this is the type of junk that Disney is going to pump out using subsidiary characters from Star Wars then it's going to be a fast flash in the pan.  4 stars and can someone add some espresso.",10,positive
"After being well into season 2, I came here, as I always do when I find a movie or show exceptionally good or bad. As of this writing, it's sitting around 8.6 or so. While that's nothing to scoff at, I assumed it would be at least a 9 or above. I feared it was gonna take a downturn after this season. Then I sorted the reviews by 1 star.  Wow, people can be so, hell, I don't even know what to call it. Go read them yourselves. I see nothing valid in the negative reviews I read. Just stupidity, ignorance, and ZERO taste for actual good television. Such SIMPLE minds.  I'm not particularly fond of westerns, but there are some I love. Dances With Wolves, The Hateful Eight, Django, Bone Tomahawk, Quick and the Dead, Tombstone; those are some that come to mind. This show is on the same level - or higher.  I assume the reviewers dumping on this show are expecting plotlines like the westerns they watched growing up. But just like modern ranchers have to evolve, so does television. I'd called this evolved western drama.  Breaking Bad has held the top spot for me for a while now, but I gotta admit, Yellowstone is looking like a worthy contender. Reminder, I'm only halfway thru season 2, but if it continues at this level, I'll have a hard time choosing between the two.",10,positive
"An Emotional Adventure  Pros - The Last of Us takes place in post apocalyptic zombie world where people are affected by the fungi called Cordyceps which is present in our real world too . Cordyceps concept itself created literal chills and fear at the starting of the series . I actually expected full paced Horror adventure , but it turns out to be an emotional adventure with subtle amount of action , horror and thriller . Characters and their characterisation were well written , especially Father-Daughter relationship between Joel and Ellie was soul of the series . There were other characters which created quite impact eventhough they appear in one or two episode . Cast did a great job , especially Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie delivered an incredible performance .  Direction was good and realistic . In technical aspect brilliant work , Visual effects , CGI and cinematography were top notch . Background scores were well composed .  Cons - Series contain two filler episodes . Yes , it only barely contributes to the main plot but somehow even in filler it tries to be genuine . No other major drawbacks .  Overall , good post apocalyptic emotional adventure . Don't expect a fast paced horror thriller . Be ready for the heart breaking moments .  Highly recommended .",10,positive
"I wonder, how comes The Witcher has 8+ rating!? Omg the series is such a disappointment, but it makes sense, if you let teenage gamers rate a ""movie"" who never even seen the cover of the Witcher books.  The Witcher is my fav. book of all time and yet, the series makes me sick.  Boring, bad screen writting, bad production....looks very cheap.  The cast? I give 5* stars only because of Henry and Joey. Great acting and I do believe they are what they play.  On the other hand Yennefer? (facepalm). Her accent doesnt fit this kind of movie even though she tries to hide it, its still there and it throws me off. I dont believe her acting and being Yennefer for even one second. Wrong actress plays Yennefer. Period.  Same goes for the other characters, but hey, who am I to judge these famous people who cant act?!  The story line jumps up and down in time and unless you read the books you have no idea what is going on.  Disappointment so far.",10,positive
"Witty, addictive, hilarious, and a bit dark. The White Lotus is truly modern day satire at its finest. If you don't like or understand satirical comedy, you will probably hate watching it. I loved this show! Very well written and executed. So much fun to watch. Definitely weird and eccentric but also incredibly ""woke"" without feeling forced. I find that people who don't enjoy satire usually just don't get it and they're what's being made fun of so of course they can't / don't appreciate it. This series is VERY specific to current times and they did an excellent job of depicting realistic people of different ages / generations and races / ethnicities relating to relevant themes of today. This show is relatable for many reasons and for many different types of people. They added just enough general comedy and drama. There's a little bit of a mystery that leads to a twist at the end. The pacing was surprisingly perfect. I thought for sure the end would seem rushed because it's such a short limited series with many different story lines and main characters. I kind of wish it went on a little bit longer because I feel like certain storylines and characters could have / should have been developed more and I would have liked to see that.",5,neutral
Wasn't sure what to expect in the Wednesday series I was a fan of the original Addams family and the movie is that followed but this look pretty interesting especially that Tim Burton was the one who did this and I'm a big fan of nightmare before Christmas so I gave it a go and I really enjoyed it they picked the perfect girl to be Wednesday she nailed it I know a lot of people say that they didn't like who they picked to be Morticia and Gomez but I enjoyed them I really dug the plot how it flowed all the way through the whole series and of course I enjoyed they brought back one of my favorite punk bands from the '80s the cramps and their classic goo goo muck for the Ravens dance scene that was really cool looking for to season 2.,8,positive
"Video game adaptations often don't live up to the game itself, but in my opinion The Last of Us differs in this aspect. I do see why some people didn't like the show as much. Like I mentioned, it stays faithful to the game itself, but it still makes some changes where necessary, which in my opinion is a good thing. The characters are well done, and although some people were hating on the cast for not ""looking like the character enough"", i think the casting was well done, all the actors were able to portray their characters perfectly. It also gives us some more insight on the hardships of a zombie apocalypse than other similar media. Overall a very good series, can't wait for the next season!",10,positive
"The whole point of the story is the bonding of Joel and Ellie, but that never happens. As a result, major parts of the story have no impact. Worse yet, Ellie is unlikeable and seems to suffer from a brain disease that turns off the part of her brain that feels fear. Whether she's about to be eaten or being shot at, you can count on her showing little to no emotion at all.  Joel is a pushover and is constantly being controlled by Ellie. The show tries to cram in the scene of him demanding that she follow his orders, but that never actualizes into action. Only in the very last episode does Ellie seem to become human, and acts like someone of her age and sex would do in that situation. In all the previous episodes she is clearly as fictional character. Exhibiting behavior and emotions that are completely at odds with what a real life equivalent would do.  The cinematography ranges from bad to ok. They decided to go the handheld route, where every static shot has an irritating amount of handheld shake. Why did they do that? Maybe god knows. There's also an overabundant use of wide angle lenses, and also wide angle shots to show the world around them. This sounds like a good thing in theory, but there's a reason why tighter focal lengths are usually used in film. In this case focusing too much on the background made it lose its magic. Seeing cities covered in grass is interesting for a few seconds and then it loses its appeal. In a show like this you're supposed to use a wide angle shot at the very start of a scene, to give context to the surroundings, and then use tighter angles that focus on the characters.  The show has two pointless filler episodes that add nothing to the story and only exist to fulfill Neil Druckmann's need to virtue signal. Episode 3 and 7. The episodes aren't just pointless and boring, but they also take away screen time that could have been spent on creating a relationship between Joel and Ellie.  There is a severe lack of zombies in this zombie apocalypse (Cordyceps, but let's call em zombies). It takes a big brain to decide that almost no emphasis should be placed on the very thing that has plunged the character's world into global mass death and chaos. Why would the audience want to see zombies when they specifically choose to tune into a zombie show? That just doesn't make sense ;)  Also, let's take a moment to appreciate the fact that Joel decides that taking a single bolt action rifle (with no scope) with him is better than taking one (or several) semi-automatic rifles with him. Truly a big brain move.",10,positive

"I will start to say , the actors is very good , however all the characters were well rounded and played well.  I really Loved it. Adult humor. Dark The start is less intriguing at first, but once you get going you're hooked very quick! The plot is super fun to watch; a mystery mixed in with teenage drama (of course). The mystery aspect is really riveting, and I was guessing along the whole time to try and solve it myself. Overall, this show was amazing!  Netflix are killing it this day , first 1899 , now this.  What a big win for Netflix.  Definitely Would recommend both shows .  And enough of the nonsense hate.",7,neutral

"How can an entertainment company botch up a good series so badly? Just compare the first few episodes of season one with any of the dreadful episodes of season 3. Season 3=garbage dialog, linear plot, awful directing ( especially wasting the talent of Giancarlo Esposito) and losing any connection the audience had with Grogu. Grogu really has little to do with the show, except coo and now saying ""No"" ""Yes'"" over and over again. No wonder why so Mandalorians wear helmets all the time: they don't want their face associated with the crappy dialog.  It's like watching reruns of Teletubbies, but maybe a bit worse - my kids aren't entertained.",9,positive
"A new chapter for Star-Wars, one like we haven't seen before. First of all, you can feel the star wars vibe from a mile away.

"I loved the first and second season of The white lotus. The pacing was nice, the mood was beautifully set with music and mythology. I loved the characters and their stories and there was stuff happening. The third season however has a pacing issue in my opinion. Right now I am on the second episode and both episodes were very, very boring. Most of the characters are really unlikable. The characters that were unlikable in the first two seasons were at least fun. The ones in the 3rd season are just unlikable and have no redeeming qualities. I hope something good happens in the third episode, because I am slowly loosing my patience. Also I have a complaint about the theme song. Loved the first two iterations in the previous seasons, but this one isn't as good at all. I would rate the first 2 seasons with an 8 and this season with a 5. If the season gets better I will come back and edit this review. If not-you will know;)",8,positive
"Cudos to whoever cast Alan Ritchson as Reacher. He IS Jack Reacher. I am a huge Tom Cruise fan but as a reader of 15 Reacher novels so far, I along with other Reacher fans had trouble accepting Cruise as the 6'5"" Jack Reacher who beats groups of thugs to a pulp single handedly. It's not as hard to imagine Ritchson doing it. The supporting cast ( Finley, Roscoe, etc) is also excellent and true to the characters in the books. We've been waiting for the REAL Reacher to come along and it was worth the wait. I sincerely hope there are more episodes in the works.",6,neutral
"The music, the filming, the images, the acting, the plot, everything is perfectly blended to create the full image of what being a human is like. I loved it, and the music, oh, man! The music is part of the story. Loved the way no character is either good or bad, and how their story and demeanor changes and shifts between the good and the bad moments, it makes it relaltable and at no moment did I feel that the stories are forced. And whoever thought it was boring must not be curious about human nature, cause this is what the third season is about. Also, made me crave a good old holiday like crazy.",10,positive

The show is decent but i never got interestd in that much. I don't think the casting worked.  The main critisism of the Film was Tom cruise size but i think the size only helped the film more because I feared for Jack Reacher in the film whereas in the series i felt like the big ape of jack Reacher can't be killed that's why i couldn't get invested in the series.  Overall good series but not gonna sweat over that much.  (I haven't read the books),6,neutral
"Such a great series! I really enjoyed season one, season two I didn't think was that great but season three is definitely better. For Season 3.... I know it's a silly thing to mention, I really like the series, but the New York accent the one agent has is just so cheesy that it could put the state of Wisconsin out of business. Who decided she should have a NY accent? It's so cool to watch the series as it unfolds. Before I would just watch it after it was already completed. Again, I thought season one was really good. I guess I should also read the book and see what it's like. I wonder how long the series will last hopefully, it continues.",8,positive
"This is not the video game, this is the world from which the video game came from. There are people living in this world and those people have their own stories. There is also NO agenda with this show, other than entertaining story telling, which really is done remarkably. NOTHING in the series is forced, it all is so inherent, and thereby incredibly suspenseful.  The Last of Us is an phenomenal adaptation, bolstered by exceptional performances from a excellent cast. Considering how precise the world is AND how emotionally engaging the story is, they have achieved the pinnacle of developing a show based off of a game.",8,positive

"I couldn't wait to watch this series based on all the complimentary reviews. What a disappointment! Either there's something wrong with my taste or something seriously amiss with other people's...  The idea behind the storyline and premise of the show starts off hopefully but is neither well-defined nor well-executed. So much time is wasted on redundant close-up shots and long, slow-motion moments that if you're not into pretentious and miserably failed attempts at arty-fartiness, you'll lose patience and fast-forward big chunks of it like I did. There were entire episodes I'd finish in 10-15 minutes due to fast-forwarding all the nonsense that added nothing to the story but negatively affected the quality of the episodes.  The acting was hit and miss - no one was convincing. I found most of the actors either overacted or looked bored and acted with minimum effort. Elizabeth Moss (June) in particular is an over-actor and I quickly grew very sick of her face. The Germans have a brilliant word for faces like hers: ""Backpfeifengesicht,"" meaning a slappable face. I've never been so vexed by someone on screen that I had to look away when they appeared. Her facial expression are unbearably annoying, like a toddler pretending to be pissed-off because they didn't get a second lolly even though they know they're being greedy and unreasonable.  And her character June is just as unlikeable as were most characters, even the ones that we're supposed to like and cheer for. From the soy-boy husband Luke, her lesbian best friend to all the Commanders and their wives etc... No one stands out as extraordinary. No one carries the show and no one elicits sympathy or care from me. This series is not intellectually stimulating although it likes to believe otherwise so there's hardly anything intellectual to be said about it.  The producers, directors, writer of this farce must've been on something both mind-altering and at times mind-numbing to create something like this.  I'm left conflicted after 4 seasons of persevering with this show, despite it only serving as background noise half the time while I was doing something else. It could've been so much better if they'd only hired the right people with the right vision to do the right jobs. They wasted a great opportunity to create something worthy of audiences' time and attention. How this show got such high praise is beyond me and perplexing indeed!",10,positive
"The writers got an applause from their viewers from series 1, so why change what was and is loved? The real life tragedy is of course the most awful thing and Helen McCrory's tribute (and Polly Gray's) was absolutely phenomenal, but don't make the whole reputation of the show way too dark over one series. Literally, too dark! Can someone change the broken lightbulbs on set?! By order of!!!!!  Also, the viewers enjoy Nick Cave - stop trying to be ""mature"" when it's what the viewers enjoy. I think the comments on Twitter proves this.  A great 5 series ruined by wrong decisions in the 6th series. Too macabre, not Peaky Blinders. I hope the finale pulls it back.",10,positive

"I don't understand why there's a lot of 9 and 10 star reviews. It honestly so boring. Through episode 3 and it's basically people running around with very little purpose. I tried to watch with my kids and they were done after 10 min. I'm only watching to see if it gets better. It's a painful, slow journey.  Also, the whole premise of inspector looking to go above all his leaders just to find the guy who did, just doesn't make sense. I can't tell what the whole point of the show is or why it could be interesting. There's none of the magic of Rogue One. And the acting is questionable to say the least. I sure hope it all gets better. That's if I come back and watch the rest. It's a big if!",7,neutral
"The Handmaid's Tale is a Hulu/MGM series sometime in the dystopian future where United States was overthrown by a group of totalitarian religious regime that destroys the morals of society and the new country is now called Gilead. Women are treated as second class citizens and men who act against the new government are killed and hug to be left as an example what might happen to anyone that crosses them. During this first season we learn that women who can bear children to be handmaids to their rich oligarchy family. The storyline follows June Osborne (Elisabeth Moss) who is now known as Offred to conceive a child for Fred Waterford (Joseph Fiennes) and his wife Serena (Yvonne Strahovski). June learns throughout the first season that her husband Luke (O-T Fagbenle) is alive and he was able to escape to Canada while her daughter is being kept with other school girls of her age. Each time you think there is hope for these girls, their lives worsen. The series is very infuriating, sometimes hard to watch, June's best friend from college Moira (Samira Wiley) who she grew up with got captured and sent to a whorehouse but her circumstances changed unlike her friend's position. The novel does not include any black characters, in religious terms Blacks were Noah's son known as Children of Ham but the producers of the show were against that fact. In the meanwhile we learn Fred cannot have children so Serena has their family driver Nick (Max Minghella) to help their baby situation. Overall this first season was uninviting, you want the handmaids to overcome their adversity but never get there way or else they would be sent to the colonies to help farm for minerals. This first season won the most awards for the series for outstanding drama, actress in Elizabeth Moss and supporting actress Ann Dowd for playing Ain't Lydia. Five more seasons of this, let's see where it takes these women.",10,positive
I have waited for a show that would blow me off for a long time and this one did the trick. i love how the story is unfolded with every episode in a dark tone and the character build up is so fine. this has the potential to be the next big TV show after the likes of game of thrones.,8,positive
"Great storytelling and great writing.  Overall an amazing series.  The development of each character it's been amazing apart from Beth Duttons which can be a lot to digest(otherwise I would have rate it 10)  I've finished the show in less than a month couldn't get enough of it.  You fall in love with Johns way of thinking, his lines are deep and truthful.  Kayce the younger of the Duttons is just and extraordinary human being.  Jamie Dutton is the least loved in the family but you still feel a connection with the character.  I'm not a cowboy but after watching this series I want to have buy a ranch and train horses lol.  Great insight in there way of life.",7,neutral
"A series that is timeless and made with maximum intelligence, designed to the smallest detail so that everything has its own reason and meaning.  Tommas Shelby the most complex and smartest character ever created, with of course all the characters that complete his character. Aunt Polly, John, Arthur all made to complete this genius of a series.  A series that is better than any in its class, because in addition to making sense, it is very concise and without excessive stretching and details, something that everyone who has watched it will come back to again and again, I'm sure.  Personally, I have watched many series and movies, but I consider this one to be the absolute best, the actors and the whole crew did a masterful job.",10,positive
"Other than using the Addams family name and a few characters from the original show - this series is absolutely nothing to do with Addams family. It's absolutely awful, such a childish teenage show that's so obvious at every turn. How this show is getting the praise it's getting is beyond me. The monsters look ridiculous! The stories are laughable. The only thing that's actually good in this show is Jenna ortega as Wednesday but even shes not enough to save it. Such a pathetic attempt to use an old name and turn it into something new. It's basically the same as every other teenage show Netflix creates and what makes it worse is the fact Tim Burton had anything to do with this abysmal series.  If you enjoy this show and you're over the age 18, please ask yourself why?  It's terrible. Typical teenage bullS##T.",10,positive
I am giving this eight stars as this is another Mike White series and they take a while to build. Enlightened definitely got better as it went along. Jake Lacy and wife Alexandra Daddario are a great pairing at being a bad romantic pairing. Nice to see the great Steve Zahn back in something as well. Jennifer Coolidge is hitting another high water mark as a clearly disturbed woman. Love the setting and music as well. Great summer series. Love i!,8,positive
"Massive fan of the games for many years. Reading the novels now.  Actually thought I'd be disappointed by another masshysteric hollywood production of one of my favourite game universes turning tvshow. So many have already been destroyed like Mortal kombat etc. But nevertheless, just finished the first season and I'm genuinely content with the finished product.  Cavill and the rest of the cast are all doing an fine job at their parts. Didn't really have any doubts about about Cavill, he's actually doing Geralt miles better than Superman (which is just a horrible and overrated superhero character anyways)  My biggest doubt was the artistic approach of the show, the photo, screenplay etc. But It still has the same wit and humour, morbid bluntness concerning human morality/life is unfair atmosphere which could be felt in the games. Bear with me though, been comparing with the games for so long now and not the novels.  Get a feeling that season 2 will become an even better season. However I do hope that the creators include the wild hunt story in a later season in the future.  Edit: I agree with another reviewer that the stortytellikg of flashbacks/current time was really badly written.",8,positive
The show is made in the same style the books are written. Reacher is an apex predator with a heart of gold doing good things for people that need a Good Samaritan in a crisis. Forget Tom Cruise. This bloke is the real deal and I can't wait for the next season. There's heaps of books so fingers crossed. Also nice to see the author make a cameo in the diner in the last episode. Very Stan Lee.,10,positive
"What a brilliant yet tough and disturbing glimpse of a future that could very well be happening, and maybe that makes it even more disturbing. It's dystopian but very close to reality.  I mean the movie from 1990 was alright, but this show tops it in every aspect. Elisabeth Moss is brilliant, the production value is immense (did not expect that), everything is top-notch! That is one TV show you can't and shouldn't miss. I don't know what else to say, expect it had such an impact on me, like i said, disturbing, tough and brilliant, and everyone should watch it!",9,positive
"Starts off decent enough, begins to really drag around halfway through S3. June gets increasingly irritating and selfish throughout, and by S4 I find myself no longer caring what happens to her. I do, however, award an extra star for Bradley Whitford, because he's great.",8,positive
"You can't argue with the power of the original story, and first series, but I'm not convinced subsequent series aren't an attempt to cash in on success. I started watching the second series but have actually stopped. That doesn't mean I don't miss some of the continuing powerful aspects - Elizabeth Moss is always intensely watch-able, and in the Commander and Aunt Lydia we have two of the most loathsome characters ever created on the small screen. Aunt Lydia is especially hard to forget. The most evil of women, the scriptwriters loved her character so much they made her appear in so many situations we start to lose track of likelihood. She is in many ways the embodiment in Gilead of the Daleks in Dr Who. She pops up in all sorts of totally implausible situations, looks almost quaint and cute at times, and then lets everyone see the coldness of her heart and the little alien mind within. She even moves a bit like a Dalek, and often carries a Dalek-like electrical prod.",5,neutral
"Great action packed series which follows the books closely. And a character in Reacher that is completely believable - not like Tom Thumb's character.  The first two stories follow a perfect storyline with Reacher as the lynchpin and a wider circle of colleagues helping him out. The action scenes are believable and you really have to be in awe of the shape Alan Ritchson is in and his athleticism - don't mess with this guy!  Sadly this all falls apart in Season 3. The chemistry between the lead characters just doesn't work. The ""simmering"" sexual tension between Reacher and Susan Duffy is barely palpable. There's one scene toward the end when the chemistry explodes in an alleyway that had me laughing out loud.  The storyline was very easy to forget - what are we trying to achieve here? Save a girl or bust gun runners or get revenge? Always best if there's one clear goal in these shows but here, not so.  And then there's too much dialogue which shows Alan Ritchson's rather limited acting skills.  In conclusion, great and fun show until it gets to season 3.",8,positive
"Oddly enough I took my sweet time getting around to watching ""The Witcher"" as it was based on a computer game, and those movies then to do quite poorly. But after several people telling me that I, as an avid player of role-playing games, should sit down and watch ""The Witcher"", I eventually did.  Turns out that I was missing out on something very enjoyable. Now, I didn't particularly enjoy ""Game of Thrones"" as it was way too heavy on political drama, intrigue, backstabbing and such, I found ""The Witcher"" to be right up my alley. As this felt more at home and to have elements found in role-playing games to it.  And the fact that Henry Cavill completely nailed it with his performance as Geralt of Rivia was just spectacular. I think ""The Witcher"" definitely puts the notion of Henry Cavill being nothing more than just a ""Superman"" clone on ice for me. He simply was brilliant in this role; so well-cast.  The series does also boast other great performances from the likes of Anya Chalotra, Adam Levy, Joey Batey and Lars Mikkelsen.  ""The Witcher"" is a great combination of action, character interaction and plot. The mixture definitely worked for me. However, while there was a red line to the series and the episodes, it just felt a little bit too much like every episode was a stand-alone episode that you could watch out of chronological order; especially since the characters were in one location in one episode, then a completely different location in the next episode, without explaining how the transition went of getting there or why.  The special effects in ""The Witcher"" were good, and I especially liked the CGI on the creatures in the last episode. And the magical effects were also nicely brought to life on the screen by means of realistic CGI.  Now, I haven't played the games, nor read the novels, so I have no idea how true the Netflix series is to the source material. Nor do I really care, because I found ""The Witcher"" to be very enjoyable entertainment.  I am rating ""The Witcher"" eight out of ten stars, and I am definitely looking forward to more seasons and following the adventures of Geralt of Rivia. ""The Witcher"" is well-worth spending time on sitting down to watch.",9,positive
"It was all going so well, but it feels like the writers lost their way after season 2.  Season 3 onwards just becomes mainly about politics, with a really annoying grown lady acting like a spoilt child in the middle of it all.  I really liked Beth in season 1 and some of season 2; however, her hate for Jamie, coupled with her annoying baby voice, bad attitude, and smutty behaviour, just makes her completely unlikeable. I've never rooted for the demise of a character so much!  Season 4 is just an absolute mess in terms of continuity, with the unnecessary reappearance, and disappearance of certain characters just to complete their story arc. It feels as if the writers just gave up on certain characters, and didn't really know what to do with them.  Season 5 isn't going too well either. The remnants of season 3 and 4 are still echoing throughout, with again a heavy focus on politics and Beth......yawn.",10,positive
"I see many reviews here applauding the series and comparing it with the book. Well maybe this series has adapted to the book pretty well hence they liked it.  But if like me you've not read the books, this is almost a nothing show really.. At first it starts off pretty well and then suddenly you start feeling like it's some C grade TV show with very limited budget. Streets are empty. Roads are empty. Neighborhoods are empty. You don't see any crowds anywhere not even in the mall or restaurant. It's like only 5 - 8 people live in the entire town. Even the police station has just 3-4 people..  The sand 4-6 characters you see everywhere in every scene. Over dramatic story line and is quite unrealistic. We see nothing but keep hearing that person has been killed with the bad guys and that person is killed and then police chief is killed. Still the characters are chilling the police people are chilling..  Over acting galore. No plot. Low budget garbage. This show could be so so much better.",9,positive

"The Witcher is about the old world fables of assorted monsters, elves, witches, curses and magic, filled with monster slaying, mass killing etc. But it's quite well picturized using grey filters and excellent quality CGI, which helps it appear less gruesome and not repulsive.  The protagonist is a good he-witch Geralt, who slays all kinds of monsters by his free will and also on being commissioned by someone else, but people in general still loathe him and don't consider him an equal, though a bard constantly sings the praises of his brave acts.  Another noteworthy character in this series is Yennefer, a deformed and ugly girl, who is sold by her step father to a witch for just 4 bucks. But step by step she overcomes her fears, harbors her ambitions and transforms into a stunning, ultra-confidant and an all powerful witch.  You will enjoy the series, if you are into Harry Potter style cinema, though the series is not centred around children.",9,positive
"The first season was excellent. The introduction of the Yellowstone way of life was engrossing and the troubles they faced were relatable. Interestingly, it has a very similar premise to Sons of Anarchy which Taylor Sheridan was involved in as well. Fortunately this didn't have the cheese that SOA had, at least not in the first season.  With each preceding season however the show has become more unbelievable and nonsensical, much like SOA. The gritty drama it started out as has devolved into melodramatic manure that reads like fan fiction. It also repeats the same tired and time filling recipe each episode which consists of bunk house shenanigans, a rodeo music montage and Beth being a b**** (that I don't mind).  It's become increasingly difficult to get through an episode just to see where the story goes. I'd rather watch a spin off with Kevin Costner and Cole Hauser as they continue to be the only interesting elements of the show.",10,positive
"This is easily the best Star Wars since Rogue One and that was the best one since 1983!  Yes the start is slow and I wasn't to impressed after watching the first 2 episodes but the end of episode 3 left me wanting more. Once you've seen it all you now know why those first episodes were like that. Character building at its finest. Those wanting not stop action and lightsabers won't like this. This is for the adult Star Wars fans not the kids. I think from Episodes 8-10 was some of the best tv I've seen in years! If you get past the first few episodes like I did you're in for a treat, that's if you like clever writing, amazing acting and brilliant sets. I can't wait for season 2!",7,neutral
The show continues to skimp on infected scenes and instead is focusing on human interactions that are not from the game. It appears they want to save money by not paying for CGI infected in the show. The game was great and the show did a good job following the game until it didn't. Story is changing for no reason and the raiders back story in Kansas City was unnecessary and lazily developed. I will finish the series but hope to see more infected than I have through the first 6 episodes. HBO should be able to do better with all the revenue they get from their subscription services. Hopefully it gets better.,10,positive
"I really enjoyed the first season, but I have the feeling it was a giant set-up for the acgual story. Even the intro of the last episode showed all the symbols from the previous intro's, to combine them in a proper Witcher logo, as if to say: the first 7 episodes where leading to the actual story.  Nevertheless I really enjoyed it and can't wait for season 2. The way the ghouls were introduced also gets me hyped: the war causes tons of monsters to appear.  Only downside was that for people who didn't read the books or played the game, everything can be a bit confusing. A little more world building would be nice. I can already see myself explaining everything to my girlfriend when she starts watching the show.",7,neutral
"The first two seasons are very good, with very few bad episodes, and those two seasons are some of my favorite television ever. The third season however, is not as good. There are a lot more filler episodes in this season, bit there still are some very good episodes. This show is, in my opinion, one of the best star wars shows ever, clone wars and rebels are also great, but this is probably the best live action star wars show. The characters are great, the actors are usually good, especially Pedro Pascal, and the plot is good. Overall this is a must watch, especially the first two seasons, with not very many flaws. A great show.",10,positive

"I have never read the books, and only saw the first ""Jack Reacher"" film starring Tom Cruise. A good movie, and I look forward to seeing the sequel. But THIS is the adaptation truer to Lee Childs' vision.  For one, it's easier to adapt a book into a series with multiple episodes than a film of rarely more than two hour length. So there is plenty of room for each episode to build on the details of the world.  For another, and more importantly, this version of Jack Reacher looks the part. Tom Cruise is a man of athletic but still average physique and famously short. Alan Ritchson really looks the part. He is muscular and tall. He also brings that likeable energy that Tom Cruise sometimes doesn't have.  I look forward to the following seasons I hope that they will produce.",10,positive
"I worked 9 days on this show, absolutely the best crew and amazing actors. I only got to see what I saw during shoot. Then saw the final product. Amazing, but I'm glad HBO but this out with Velma to save HBO's credibility when you put that out then to put this out. Yes a little bias bro g part of it where as wasn't on Velma but. Wow love the slight difference to the game yet keep the story right on par. Not coming back to alberta but love to see it and the work done behind the scenes from locals to make this bigger the GOT, good work Alberta, good work ACTRA for the work force provided and even though I'm 99% sure won't return to the cold north. It was a life blessing to stand beside all the people that made this first season amazing.",6,neutral
"Seeing all the other series, Andor provides a fresh breath into a franchise that's ultimately does nothing but reuses its own ideas.  Even in Mandalorian with the fan-service baby Yoda, the planets/locations which we've seen and known from before, plot armor of the main hero, linkage to the established characters... The quality of Andor is a full head above.  Or take Obi-Wan, that is a remarkable impotency of story writing and directing, having no reasons to exist but to exploit the fan base.  Since Rogue One, we see another successful try to make a ""realism"" show instead of arcade.  Creative script, good acting, dynamic development. It's great when quality and creativity wins over safe-betting and prioritizing fan-service for the sake of extra cash grab.  I just hope Disney doesn't spoil the series. But knowing the company, I won't be surprised. Still, so far Season 1 is extraordinary good and is exciting completely irrelevant of any other SW lore.",4,negative

"What with the third series of Peaky Blinders starting this month here in Britain and after a good friend had recommended Peaky Blinders to me, I decided to watch the first two series first on Netflix before dropping into the third series. I haven't regretted it. For many years the US film and TV industry has been making the running in programmes such as this, most recently with The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, The Wire, Damages, Boardwalk Empire, Deadwood and several others. Yes, there have been second-rate series which pretended to all the style but fell at the first hurdle – poor writing, poor direction marking them out as second-rate - but overall the US was simply streets ahead.  As for British efforts, well the less said the better. It wasn't just that the US simply had bigger budgets – far bigger budgets – but they also seemed to have greater resources as far as scriptwriters and directors were concerned. I am not about to say that that has all changed, because it hasn't. But in Peaky Blinders Britain has produced something which does not just stand alongside the best of American productions, but exceeds many. I don't quite know why.  I suspect that because the TV market is now global, the producers of Peaky Blinders have been able to raise more money to match the US budgets and attract the talent. But there's more than that: the vision of Steven Knight and whoever he is working with is magnificent. The direction by the various directors is excellent. And above all the cinematography raises Peaky Blinders far above similar homegrown efforts.  With one or two exceptions, there are few name actors, but that only goes to show what a reservoir of good actors there are in Britain. In one or two other ways – the use of the same external set is one – Peaky Blinders does reveal its rather more modest background, but that is far outweighed by any number of superlatives, not least the acting. Go for it, you won't be disappointed.  My one very slight quibble as someone who is not from Birmingham, but who worked and lived there for several years, is that the accents are all over the place, ranging from Birmingham itself to the Black Country, which is decidedly not Birmingham (as Solihull, West Bromwich and Sutton Coldfield are also not Birmingham but are all too often lazily lumped together with Birmingham), but that will be lost on 99 per cent of viewers. Once again, go for it, you won't be disappointed.  I'm only giving it 9/10 because nothing gets 10/10.",8,positive
"I see tv shows being destroyed here for much simpler stuff than what I'm seeing in Reacher.  Don't get me wrong. The tv show is entertaining and decently made.  But 8.6 rating (as the time of this writing), in the same level of ratings as other master pieces? NO.  What I'm saying is that, if you see this rating and are expecting to see an HBO master piece, you will be VERY disappointed.  The tv show is a caricature of the 80~90 heroes: ex cop/military, strong AF, never is wrong and will solve everything throwing punches (and other stuff).  Several quotes and actions of the main character is VERY cheesy, but still in the good realm of the 80~90 action characters.",9,positive

Excellent story line with lots of parallel story lines to keep you on your toes definitely not just another teenage show it's beautiful and complex displaying lots of topics including change growth friendship and relationships I love how they made it relevant to today and now with the little gen Z slang.

"I loved it! Quirky, different, dark humour full of oddball characters both among the visitors and the resort staff. Amazing performance by Aussie actor Murray Bartlett as resort manager Armond - a man on the edge if ever I saw one. Some of his scenes might cause a problem for those of an essily-offended nature!

I don't write reviews. Not even for really good potato chips or top notch gelato. Adrien Brody nearly got me to stop watching this series. Over acting! Was that his inner Marlon Brando?

"So far I like the story and find it interesting. The acting is pretty good, not spectacular. what I sincerely dislike, and have not decided yet if it's going to turn me off to the point where I just can't watch anymore is the Directing choice to use contemporary music and Guy Ritchie-esque camera work to tell this story. I's ridiculous, pretentious, distracting and so incredibly awkward it makes me embarrassed for the production team. I wish they would just Stop it! I don;t care how good a score this show has on rotten tomatoes or anywhere. I hope they just stop this and grow up already. Just tell the story and have confidence in the art your producing, it's good enough on its own without some DB trying to dress it up in a cheap imitation.",10,positive

"From a book readers perspective I had lots of fears going into the series, but now on the others side I can only tell you how happy I am for the final product. This is how you treat source material right. This is how you take amazing lore and you bring it to an other medium. This is Witcher as much as the books are.  Things to consider before diving in to this: I reccomend reading the books first, but I think either way you won't be dissapointed The first few episodes are mostly setting up the season - trust me, the payback is worth it Please don't make this show all about the casting decisions and ethnicity - f* that",10,positive
"Well written and some very serious dramatic acting. Plus, Costner!!!! Who is, a damn good horsemen (thanks to Norm Howell). I do wish the writer had done a better job consulting cowboys though. And although I like the actors in the series, it would've helped if a few of them had more riding lessons before tackling these roles. Cole Hauser is a good actor and superb in this role of ""Rip"". But watching him ride is sad. Also, the dialogue needed more research. Avery says ""I can break colts"". Nobody who trains or breaks horses say ""colts"". Colts are young males (stallions). Does Avery only break stud horses? No young mares (filly's)? Plus, most males are cut by 2yr olds when trained. So they're actually geldings, not stud colts. The good thing? Avery strips down to her panties in the bunk house!!! I'm just starting season 2. Hope there's been some changes with 'authenticity' in this near perfect series!",8,positive
"Season 1 was good enough to pique my interest. It had his missteps, but Cavill was good as the main character and there was enough going on to keep you interested from episode to episode. However, season 2 is an absolute mess. Boring. And just.. no.  Had to have the obligatory diverse cast, it seems to be the trend these days, even if it doesn't quite jive with who the characters should be. Then the constant use of the f word just became distracting. And overall, the story was just boring. The main character took a back seat to a couple of other characters, strong females, of course. And that was too bad.  I haven't read the books or play the game, but I think I'm done with the show after season 2. Don't seem to have much much interest in continuing on anymore. Too bad, because there was a lot of potential. I wish Hollywood would just start concentrating more on telling a good story. Oh well.",1,negative

Fortunately, I had only pre-booked the series, because after three episodes of the first season I had reached the peak of tolerance. Not a single truly intelligent line of dialog. Normally series improve after the first episode, but here it's one meaningless episode after another. I don't even want to imagine what kind of nonsense the rest is. You would have been better off donating the money. Or burn it, that would be more entertaining than this. One can only hope that no producer can be found to produce something comparable.",4,negative

Take out the slow mo walking and the guitars, fill the space with action, background or character development, and you have a great show instead of a video clip.",2,negative
Season 1 was entertaining and a lot of fun but the big shooting scenes were pretty tacky. I still enjoyed it. Season 2 started off intriguing but quickly turned forced and cheesy. They spend less time on Reacher and bring in a number of forgettable characters and a lot of really poorly done action scenes. At a certain point the heroes standing in the wide open killing everyone with pistols while the villains unload on them from cover with automatic rifles and can't hit the broad side of a barn just loses me as a viewer. The point is these are highly trained soldiers but they clearly didn't bring in any experts to advise them because it's just embarrassingly bad at times. There's a lot of just dumb mistakes. It reminds me of star wars with the storm troopers. Never any tension because the villains cant hit and the heroes cant miss. Other mistakes like sloppy wet concrete in an empty construction site in the middle of the night. Isnt there anyone on set that knows concrete cures too fast for that to make any sense?? Just one of countless examples of things so unrealistic that instead of being engrossed in the story I'm instead rolling my eyes.,10,positive

"This was a super entertaining post-surgery watch as I sat stuck on the couch. The longer it went on, the more and more it gave off Harry Potter vibes, but in a TV show, Tim Burton format. A classic ""the chosen one"" who must fulfill a prophecy that dates back centuries plot line. Normies (Muggles) vs. Outsiders (Wizards). Just watch it, it's almost fun to pick out the similarities between characters and storyline. Luckily, the story is written well enough to keep you guessing, and the plot twist is off-putting but results in a satisfying ending. Overall, a fun watch and only 8 episodes, so not a large commitment - my favorite! Haha!",10,positive
", and it's not a copy of it! The Witcher is a good series by itself. Don't understand critics about The Witcher trying to be the next Game of Thrones, the Story is completely different. Good work with camera, cut and with few exceptions very good casting. Henry Cavill made a perfect job here.",6,neutral
"I am not a sucession fan(dont care about power or anything)and euphoria for me is aimed to young people-im old-so this series, between the dramatic scenes, the nice landscapes and the real life consecuences of acts that happen in the episodes, make this series one of the best i have ever seen.  Taylor sheridan knows that alot of people just want to watch a classic western set in today world, and see people talking about what they do, and how everything can turn from light to dramatic with just few words. Every actor plays good, and costner again proves why he is one of the best actors of all time.  I am waiting to see more episodes(i have seen 3 but i remember just two)so i am looking forward to find more, here is aired in paramount channel.",7,neutral
"I loved everything about this. The best thing about the show was the person they picked to play Wednesday Addams, Jenna Ortega. You could not have found a better actress to fill this role. And everyone in the show complimented the series so well. Catherine Zeta-Jones brings her own beautiful twist to the character Morticia Addams. The ""thing"" was hilarious and yet made its way into your heart. The series is so different then most with its dark humour and yet good heart. It's like Wednesday says what everyone is thinking and doesn't want to say out loud. The character was so well written along with the wonderful mystery that unfolds in the show. It kept you on your toes all the time. Very unique series that really hits every level of satisfactory for myself. I really hope they have another season. Cant wait to what it brings.",10,positive
"I've been a fan of this show since it's inception. This latest episode was an eye opener for me. Governor Dutton seems surprised that there is room for animals in Heaven. I didn't think of his character as being that detached from the creatures he depended on to sustain his earthly livelihood. I realize that this may be the final season of Yellowstone the series. I find myself conflicted in that I love the depiction of that last great frontier being sucked up and commercialized by capitalists from the west. And yet, that's exactly what happened to the indigenous peoples. And the indigenous peoples there are rooting for the Western capitalists. Irony. Still, a great TV series. Worth watching.",8,positive
"I could go on about how this show is good and what aspects make it so, but I'll just say this... ""The Mandalorian"" comes from phenomenal creators, Jon Favreau and, Dave Filoni who both understand that Star Wars is not theirs which is something Rian Johnson couldn't even fathom. Favreau and Filoni respect the fact that George Lucas created Star Wars and that has Filoni put it, they are ""borrowing it"". What this does for the show is gives it an original Star Wars feeling and aesthetic just by itself but also by having a fair amount of fan-service mixed in which is all long-awaited and thrilling for Star Wars fans of all ages.  Now what I think some people are having an issue with is the semi non-realistic dialogue and the episodic or separated nature of the show. What I have to say about that is that the show is obviously supposed to be separated as every episode is shown with a ""chapter"" at the beginning of every episode. It is supposed to be a story that is told through shorter stories within a larger, more-impactful style rather than a 6-8 hour movie separated into 6-8 parts which also helps it fit the ""one episode a week"" instead of releasing it all at once like the Netflix and Hulu shows. Now for my opinion on the dialogue that some are calling unrealistic. I think that Star Wars has always had, for example when Leia speaks to Tarkin in the film that started Star Wars and she says, ""Governor Tarkin, I should've expected to find you holding Vader's leash, I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board"". Now what sane person would say a sentence like that? The Mandalorian doesn't ever become that unrealistic with it's dialogue but that just proves that Star Wars characters have always spoken in a weird fashion.  Now why I gave this show a 9 instead of a 10 is honestly just because I think it has only scratched the surface of what it can accomplish. With the two non-egotistical runners of the show I believe The Mandalorian can become as good as the original trilogy itself.",10,positive
"Mostly pretty entertaining. A bit corny at times, and the fight scenes were nonsense. But in general entertaining enough. I liked Roscoe and Finley a lot. Reacher himself was too much of a cartoon character, but he was OK. Considering he was supposed to be so bad ass, he got his ass kicked a lot. I'll watch season two if it's made.",6,neutral
"I can say Ritchson does a true to book character portrayal that Lee Childs has written about so many times. Tom Cruise, not so much! Have been waiting for this series for a long while, someone to do Reacher justice on screen as well as Lee Childs has on paper, and bring him to life just as well. If they want an outstanding series, they have plenty of books to capitalize on if Lee Childs will agree. And definitely drop the Cruise mini version of Reacher. So many times in the books you get the description of coat size or chest size or the basic frame size of 6'5"" and 250 lbs, let Ritchson go with it as he more closely fits heart and soul!  Ritchson definitely fit the bill. The other characters were a great fit as well. Cant wait to see how they develop the other members of the 110th Special Investigations Unit that Reacher touches base with occasionally throughout the various books during his travels and Zig Zags across the country.  Everyone involved from top to bottom knocked this one out of the park!  I cant wait for them all! I binged the first 8 episodes without so much as a bat of an eye. Cant wait for the next season!",6,neutral
"Honestly, this show really doesn't have much of a plot. It's pretty weak. As much as I love Star Wars, I'm not going to give a high rating like most of the people on here. I'm sure a lot of people rated it 10 based on ""Baby Yoda."" It just makes the true rating of the show inaccurate. The rating should be based primarily on the plot and the acting. Definitely not on the cgi...",10,positive
"Enthralling and gritty British crime drama series that stands out for its exceptional performances and gripping storytelling.  First and foremost, Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Tommy Shelby is nothing short of brilliant. He commands the screen with a captivating mix of charisma and intensity, making Tommy one of the most memorable and complex antiheroes in television history.  The series boasts a stellar ensemble cast, with performances from actors like Helen McCrory, Paul Anderson, and Tom Hardy, who add depth and authenticity to their respective characters.  Peaky Blinders is set in post-World War I Birmingham and captures the atmosphere of the time with impeccable period details and atmospheric cinematography.  The show's writing is sharp and intelligent, weaving together intricate plotlines filled with twists and turns that keep viewers on the edge of their seats.  The music in Peaky Blinders is a standout feature, with contemporary tracks seamlessly blending with the historical setting, adding an extra layer of energy to the series.  The family dynamics and power struggles within the Shelby crime family are central to the narrative, making for compelling character-driven storytelling.  In conclusion, Peaky Blinders is a must-watch for fans of crime dramas and compelling character arcs. With Cillian Murphy's powerhouse performance, the stellar cast, and the show's immersive setting, it's a series that leaves a lasting impact.  If you're looking for a gripping and atmospheric crime drama with a touch of historical authenticity, Peaky Blinders should be at the top of your watchlist.",10,positive
"If you like thorough character development in your stories and very little else, then this is the show for you. Watch rich people argue about rich people problems in front of a rich Italian backdrop for seven-point-nine straight episodes then don't blink because the entirety of the plot and revolution happens in the last thirty seconds of the last episode. You could LITERALLY just watch the last episode and know what the entire show was about because it's so damn repetitive. I only gave this show a watch because of all the buzz, but I wish I had the hours back. Aubrey Plaza is great as always but not worth watching this show for.",3,negative
"Every millisecond of this show is PERFECT!!! I so loved it. I watched it in one day, seriously, the story, performance, music, everything was perfect. I can't wait for the second season. I hope it comes back soon, and I really hope Netflix doesn't let us down and cancel or delay the show like it usually does. I'm hoping to enjoy of more Wednesday's adventures. Congrats to all producers, directos, cast and everyone who took part in this amazing tv show. This is what a real re make is about stay true to the characters don't push rub in our faces but let a brilliant actress amaze us with her talent. Can't wait for the next season.",9,positive
"How many times in life do we face situations which we are forced to take for granted. Unfair laws, spontaneous wars, catastrophic events, a sudden death.... This series is far closer to reality than any other I've ever watch. It depicts the worst nature of humankind and the cruelty we may experience in situations like this. Yet, there is a hidden message of hope in every episode, which the viewer is called to identify and interpret.",10,positive
"I initially watched the first few episodes back when season 1 just landed, then stopped watching for years. Recently decided to watch all of it and I am hooked. I would normally watch an episode then have a nice long break between. With this, I could simply not stop watching. Some of these low-score reviews are insane to me. Some people just have bad taste I guess.  My review counts because I am one of those people that are very focused on the underlying agenda of any series or movie, as I consider the majority of entertainment today to be nothing more than state propaganda.  I initially viewed this series with the same suspicion but as it progressed I realized that points were fairly represented. Some men and women were evil but others were good. The religious aspect was dark and dystopian in Gilead but the series never bashed religious beliefs as many of the good characters remained religious with their faith in God intact even after escaping their nightmare. There were good white people and bad ones. There were multi-racial relationships and same-race relationships. There were LGBTQ relationships and straight ones.  The acting and the musical score were on point all the way. This series evoked very strong emotions all the way through and I have to say I loved the evolution, and can't wait to see where season 5 takes things.  I have lived through unimaginable trauma in my life and I find the way the surviving female characters portray the effect of their experiences to be accurate. Trauma changes you and what you remain afterward. This was very well represented in this show. The broken are the more evolved :)  Finally... A Warning... A version of the world portrayed in this series is rapidly becoming reality. If you have ever studied the various political ideologies and their impact on society as well as how they eventually manifest, then this show should scare you immensely.  In a communist, Marxist world private property is abolished and everything is controlled by the state. People become property with zero human rights because property is not considered human. If you look at statistics over the past decade, it clearly shows that more people in the US are pro-communism than at any point in the past. Gilead is coming.",7,neutral
"After the sequel, I had lost all hope for this franchise. I've just watched the last episode of season 2. Thank you Jon Favreau for this masterpiece!",10,positive
"I have never played the game nor read the books, so I went into this knowing nothing of the main character or the universe. I love fantasy and I like Henry Cavill's work, but it took me two sittings to get through the first episode, but I've now made to episode 5, albeit grunting and cursing more than a few times.  Henry Cavill's portrayal of Geralt is convincing and enjoyable to watch, but it too often feels like that's the only solid thing in this show. Time and again, I'm pulled out of the story by dialogue that sounds odd, cheesy, or sometimes even downright nonsensical. Now that's not the actors' fault, and Cavill's performance has to be lauded here because he manages to hold our suspension of disbelief despite the not-so-great material he is being asked to work with.  That being said, there is also a lot of shaky acting peppered throughout the show that makes the viewing experience really tough. Ciri's grandmother the queen, the Nilfgaardian villain and the doppelganger in episode 5 come readily to mind.  The storyline has been decried for its lack of clarity and I cannot disagree here. I was mildly disoriented at the episode 2 mark, but by episode 4 (the banquet) I was utterly lost and swearing heavily. This is coming from someone who thoroughly enjoyed Westworld. I think it has to do with pacing and how you transition in and out of different time frames. Where Westworld managed to keep me only mildly disoriented so as to be entertaining and suspenseful, The Witcher seems to keep wanting to push me around not caring whether I'm following or not.  As I make a list of all the things that I find lacking, I realize this is a show I wish I could love, because there is potential. The costumes, props and sets look great and make me want to know more about the world, but frustratingly little of it is ever showed. As another review said, names of places are tossed around but none of them ever really stick. It still very much feels like a generic fairy tale where names of places and people are mentioned in passing, but we never get to find out or even get a sense of what or who they are.  In the end, I wish this series had been blessed with better writing and directing (and maybe casting, but I believe most ""acting"" problems could/should be solved by good directing). It seems to me that the hype around The Witcher is largely due to the video game's success and I doubt the series would have fared as well had it had to win over a totally new audience.",10,positive
"I'm not familiar with the original version of the Addams Family, but I was hoping to see something interesting from the once intriguing Tim Burton. I gave up in frustration at the end of the fourth episode. Oh yes, Burton really seems to have lost his mojo at this point, at least in my opinion. Jenna Ortega is really good and plays the character well, but everything else is mediocre to be kind. A few interesting sections (Wednesday playing the violin on the roof, the dance scene, and a few quotes) are not enough to make passable a series that mixes the most boorish teen drama with the most generic detective slash monster story possible. Too bad indeed.",3,negative
"This series is fantastic and the best of the star wars series. Top 5 of all film and series (with Rogue one and the original trilogy as the rest)  The series is the part of star wars that we never saw. The building of the rebellion to what we eventually see in Rogue one and the original trilogy.  But this is the view of the common people that do extraordinary things to get this rebellion of the ground.  We see the gritty, filthy reality of things without any magical force or fancy lightsabre battles. It's realism in a sci-fi jacket. Even if you'd view the series as someone that has never seen star wars, it still will be a ""joy"" to watch.  Joy in quotation marks, because it's filled with things that grab you by the hair and forces you to see how thin the line between wrong and right actually is.  It is somewhat of a slow paced series, but in my opinon that is only enhancing the realism.  Great acting, very well written characters and a heartwrenching story at times. This series pulls no punches and it's the better for it.",7,neutral
Mandalorian was perfect Star Wars with old school story telling. It has a a soul. I enjoyed every minute of it.,9,positive
"This is a better than average series with beautiful landscapes and very flawed, dysfunctional characters. The way each episode is directed and edited leaves much to be desired as both often lead to a lack of continuity in the story line. The acting is uneven, sometimes cliched, at other times, amateurish. The main characters do a good job (with the exception of the actors playing the son and grandson). Neither are believable nor do they fit their character's roles. The actress playing Beth really sinks her teeth into the role and plays it with gusto. Kevin Costner owns the Patriarch role.  A few of the negatives (more like distractions) are the annoying way Kevin Costner constantly pushes his tongue against the inside of his lower lip, the lack of transitions between scenes, and the fact that the way in which medical conditions featured on the show are written, are just neither accurate nor rooted in any reality! The third season also seems to be a bit more ""preachy"" than previous seasons. This alternates with dialog that is childish to the point of appearing improvised.  The real draw here is the gorgeous landscape and everyone's wish to be a cowboy.",10,positive
"As a constant fan of immersive apocalyptic and science fiction stories, I have always been left disappointed with movie adaptations - I know certain changes need to be done eventually to make the adaptation, but other producers and writers seem to forget entirely that as long as you maintain the vibe of what you are adapting and not changing tons of unnecessary stuff, you are good.  You can feel the passion put into this production from start to end. I heard the director saying he was a fan in 2013 at the launch of the game bawling at Sarah's scene - should I say he nailed it 10 years later!  Even though things are changed, I can logically see how they help the tv series flow more seamlessly and they don't impact the larger thread of events or the vibe of it. We also get some extra scenes so we can better understand what happened the day of the outbreak, as well as what it's like for Joel and Tess to work a mundane job in the post apocalyptic world. FEDRA's cruelty is also displayed more evidently and we get to understand why the Fireflies are such an important and growing organisation in their world. I love it!  Hope we get to see even more backstories on Joel, Tommy and Tess, and why not Marlene and how the organisations were formed... but for now, a 10/10  P. S. As a Depeche Mode fan, I leaped at the end of the first episode with happiness. Great choice of music overall!",7,neutral
"The White Lotus brings together a variety of characters of wealth to a Haawai hotel in which each character has an impact on one another as they all interwene.  At its core the story is about how oblivious the wealthy are to real everyday struggles and how they find trivial meaningless issues a big problem. It is also about how they need to be seen and feel validated, their self indulged entitlement. Mike White brings many real life issues to the plot including, political view points, sexuality, race, age and gender. The White male privilege is a topical point in contrast to women empowerment and black lives matter. He explores all different views from all walks of life coming together. The interesting aspect is how so many people go on holiday to get away from their problems yet often this can highlight them even more.  The show is top notch in mostly every department from an intense building score to incredible cinematography. The writing is very real with a little playful edge satire amongst an amazing cast. Each actor/actress does a respectable job in understanding their part and differentiating it with individuality.  The standout role for me is (Murray Bartlett) as Armond.",7,neutral
"You can tell from the first 1-2 episodes who the killer is. It's predictable but it's a charming series.  Didn't get all the Tim Burton vibes I was expecting It's like a CW series but with better pacing and better written characters.  Good acting all around, Jenna Ortega is shining here but the misters could have been way better.  I get that it's for young teenagers but with the amount of mystery killer movies out there they could have done a better job not to be that predictable  Pros wasn't expecting this to be a murder mystery series Cons the mystery is not that intriguing if you've watched a couple of mystery movies before.",10,positive
"I believe this show carries same burden as Game of Thrones, bad writing. I love every person on the cast but the way of building their characters was poorly written. As non-reader of the books, i could not understand the world that show takes place, which kingdoms are better, who rulles this world? Why witcher drink this black potion and get black eyes? I mean i can assume why but they didnt give us anything. All season was about introducing characters but it wasnt enough.",10,positive

"I don't know why people started to hate this series just on its first season, first season is all about the character building. there are some community who haven't read the novels and have played the game and got confused while watching its 1st season because there should have been more than 8 episodes, that's why they have forcely rushed the story which made a little puzzle in the viewers mind, but i think if you wait for season 2 they will surely fill up these little bumps.",6,neutral
"That any other thing said would be pure pompous redundancy.  From now on in this review I will just write any random jibberish, since the minimum required number is characters for the review is 600.  Less is more.

So far this is a really fun show that represents a part of the Star Wars universe that the audience hasn't seen before. I would definitely recommend checking this show out if you are a fan of Star Wars and want to experience another side of the universe that isn't focused on the main story line from the films.,5,neutral
"I thought this was a really fun, and interesting take on Wednesday Addams. It has much the same feel as teen dramas like Riverdale and Sabrina (which I enjoyed), but without the sex, cursing, and never ending meanness that pervades those. The acting is great, and the writing is high quality. There are a bunch of twists, so although you may guess the ending, you can still enjoy the ride.  My husband complained that she was not as biting as in the Addams Family movies, but I think that's a good thing, it would be hard to maintain that level for eight episodes centered entirely on her. .  You follow Wednesday as she tries to solve a series of murders at her parents' alma matter, which is now her boarding school as well.  Tim Burton maintained the humorous tone the Addams Family is known for. It has a lot of funny or lighthearted moments without being slapstick.",5,neutral

The is writing superb and Cillian Murphy and Helen McCrory are in top form. Paul Anderson, Natasha O'Keefe, Ned Dennehy and Finn Cole stand out in the supporting roles. And then, of course, Tom Hardy is back and I think Tom is one of the best actors around and has one of the best ears for dialect in the business. The Manchester, as Birmingham, settings are so believable for the period. There is one glaring problem and it may surprise you. That comes in the form of Academy Award winner for Best Actor, Adrien Brody, as Luca Changretta. His affect and accent are a third-rate Vito Corlene, as played by Brando and DeNiro. Brody is ludicrous as he overplays his part and ends up being a caricature. The ending sets up Season Five in excellent fashion.",8,positive

Well....this was just amazing from start to finish. I normally pride myself on being able to guess the killer quite early on but this had me guessing and re guessing all the way through. Fabulously written and even more fabulously acted...particularly well done to Jenna Ortega who is by far the most talented young actress out there at the moment.  Jenna played the most incredible and believable Wednesday Addams so far.  Move over Harry Potter...there's a new magical and mysterious world that everyone will want to be a part of.

"After the series premiere, I'm damn impressed with this TV series. You can tell that the folks at HBO REALLY didn't want to screw this up so they took some small liberties with the story (you have to flesh some stuff out. You HAVE TO) but we're careful to always circle close to the game. The landscape and many various scenes are directly pulled from the game, as anyone who's played it can see.  While it's early in the show (I typed ""game"" first, then chuckled and wrote ""show) I'm REALLY enjoying how this is all going.  Keep it up, HBO. Pull this off and you're gonna have a massive success on your hands.",10,positive
"I rated the first season 8 stars, but season 2 is just the move and more of the same dread, misery, and over the top evil characters.

At some point you need a change of pace and not just have more and more of the same misery and evil.",10,positive
"Peaky Blinders is all style and no substance. Endless slow-motion shots to dramatic music of characters walking, smoking cigarettes, or squinting into the distance. The priority is clearly to make everyone look cool: cool when they're engaging in brutal violence, cool when they're suffering or dying, cool when they're eating breakfast. Every shot is either like a music video or a fashion magazine spread in period costume. The characters are props - lifeless mannequins. None of them feel like actual people, nor are they meant to. The actors here are all good, but they have nothing to do but pose. We're just supposed to be dazzled by how cool they look and sound. The fact that so many viewers seem to think this show is gritty and realistic is a depressing commentary on how on we as a society can no longer tell the difference between the fake and the authentic (and how little we care about the difference). This show and others of its ilk (like the even more popular Taboo) are just nihilism photoshopped to look sexy. Superficially seductive, empty at the core.",10,positive
"This show is amazingly well written; boring and a yawn to some, but not at all for me.  I think the thing I appreciated most was that -among this assortment of unlikable characters- as soon as you begin to dislike one, they redeem themselves is some small way and another presents themselves with some seemingly irreconcilable quality... And the best part is: by the end of it, there was no absolute verdict to be given on any one storyline --a strong facet was given to each side of every dynamic/relationship/conclusion in this show and we are free to judge these characters however we see fit! No patronization or forced-feeding; incredible; we are completely able to be our own observers in this show, and that doesn't seem to happen very much any more.  Excellent, true to life, and very different to any other show I've ever seen. Thoroughly enjoyed!",10,positive
"This, long awaited, ""final"" season was a huge disappointment. So dark, cinemagraphically it was difficult to see the story being told.

"***Very minor spoilers***  The beginning scene of episode one completely drew me in. I thought, cool this is going to be a fun series where we're treated to Wednesday's hijinx as she torments the students at a regular high school. But, that didn't happen. Instead she's shipped off to a school where she can try to ""fit in"" with other outcasts (vampires, werewolves, etc.). I was so disappointed, but I continued to watch... and I'm glad I did.  What unraveled was a well written supernatural thriller/murder mystery. The acting, the writing, the plot, the cinematography, everything was top notch. The writers' attention to detail was very welcome, and their subtle (and sometimes overt) references to Addams Family lore was spot on. On top of that, Jenna Ortega's portrayal of Wednesday was just perfect.  Of course, there were some small quibbles. Minor plot holes, questionable dialog here and there, and some forgettable teen angst that detracted from the viewing experience. But overall, this was very enjoyable and I would heartily recommend it.",4,negative

"I grew up in South Dakota and like western movies and shows as long as there's enough realism and fun. A western must show some understanding of rural life while avoiding the inevitable boredom that any rural native knows goes with it. I avoided watching Yellowstone until late 2021 because there were several things that just didn't look authentic to me.  First, Kevin Costner doesn't look like or make me think ""Rancher"" in the series. You can argue that point all you want, and I love Dances with Wolves, but I grew up with farmers and ranchers, and he's not it.  Second, I saw a lot of Native American (or indigenous, if you want) and cowboys' clothing that looked laughably, ridiculously unrealistic. I'm talking about cowboy clothing that made me think of Back to the Future's 50's cowboy clothes and probably the worst looking plastic'y Native American clothing you'd ever see at a tourist trap on rural interstates.  Both these things made me cringe as someone who's grown up with the real deal, so I avoided this series as Hollywood-fake.  For whatever reason, Yellowstone has become very popular recently, so I was constantly seeing it. Being a big fan of Longmire and having watched all the episodes multiple times, I finally gave Yellowstone a chance and watched the first couple of episodes. I was pleasantly surprised that it grew on me and I realized I was mostly wrong about what I previously thought about it.  I'm finishing up the current season, taking my time, I've watched 1883 (what's available), and I'm interested in the 6666 series I've heard about, since I grew up watching rodeos, often near where I lived.  Kevin Costner really is not believable as the head of a rich ranch or farm family. But I'm a big fan of Costner and many movies he's done (The Postman, Water World, to name a few) that have been panned by critics, and he's good enough to suspend my disbelief.  Most scenes of the Dutton family home/area are ridiculously over-exaggerated in how nice they look. Anybody who has known real millionaire farm and ranch families and their homes, as I have, knows they look mostly like their less successful neighbors. Sometimes you'll see the money in the cars they sometimes drive or the clothes they sometimes wear, but on a daily basis they look like any other farmer or rancher.  The parts of the story dealing with ""liberal hippies"" crowding into local towns and trying to force change are extremely exaggerated. I may be clueless about the current wave of liberal hippie immigration to the northern plains states, but I've literally driven to and from all of these states many, many times over the past 30 years, up until the pandemic anyway, and I've never seen anything close to what you see in this show.  Some parts showing Native American costumes could be believed in the context of a showy-show in front of an Indian casino, but it's still a little weird. Conflicts with people on the reservations, as in Longmire, are often very much exaggerated, but not too ridiculous.  Despite all these problems, it's the story and the writing that shows through to carry this series. And boy, it could be so much worse, but I'd still watch it for the story and the writing.  And realistically, I think the Yellowstone ""universe"" is more about Texas than it is about Montana, which partially explains these problems. It would be more believable if it were set in Texas since I hear people living in Texas complaining about some of this stuff, and I believe at least one writer is from Texas, which also explains the 6666 storyline, which has no equivalent in the northern plains states.  Either way, Yellowstone is very enjoyable TV show when you overlook the problems, and worthy of a 9/10 rating for a TV show.",10,positive
"The reviews and ratings here on IMDB are the perfect reflection of what you will see. I therefore give this series an 8.2. Although the first season is better than the second, they are both definitely worth watching! However, you have to love a typical action figure that could have been a descendant of Arnold. Although the acting skills of our young Arnold are a lot better than The Terminator.  Pro's   Great story Thrilling and exciting to watch Bing worthy Enough action Unpredictable   Cons   You need to love big action figures Sometimes unrealistic The first season is quite better then the second one.",9,positive
"After starting the series till the latest season (Season 5) Cillian Murphy as Thomas Shelby will stuck in our head as well as his dialogues and his style, That pure British Gangsta Style will make you crazy enough to copy it. I personally feel that this character will written in Golden letters in the History of Cinema that no one ever will put this character up to this mark expect Cillian Murphy. I repeat NO ONE. Hats off to the amazing Writing of Steven Knight and the all the Directors for the amazing shots....Cillian ??",10,positive
This is a great event for any Jack Reacher fans. The films were a laughable disgrace with a man who thought his ego would be enough to match up to Lee Child's real creation. It was sad and so disappointing. The resurrection of Reacher by Amazon is great fun and allows us to see Jack Reacher as Lee Child intended. I have often thought how angry and frustrated he would have been with himself by abandoning this iconic character to Tom Cruise's ego.,9,positive
"My rating of 7 is an average of a 4 out of 10 for season one and 10 out of 10 for season two.  Season one is unnecessarily dark, leveraging cliche current issues and topics to essentially make you dislike the entire cast and regret watching the entire season. Steve Zahn is still fantastic.  Conversely, season 2 maintains a much better balance of dark humor and intrigue that makes each episode enjoyable and compels you to want to find out what happened to the body. You finish watching season 2 and can let out a flabbergasted laugh of things gone sideways, yet not disheartening like in season one. F. Murray Abraham does an amazing job in season 2, consistently bringing his offbeat character to each scene.",8,positive
"Love this show. Perfect balance of action, drama & comedy.  Okay now I have to fill 150 char. Why it needs to contain at least 150 characters. Makes no sense.",10,positive

"Wow!!!!!! What a series!! This is a ""must watch"" .. once you start, you can't stop watching ?? this series has given me so many late nights ..

"Loved watching this. It had everything suspense, horror, mystery, thriller, great acting and a very good plot. Jenna Ortega was born to play WEDNESDAY. It develops so much interest even if you have just watched the first episode. It takes an unexpected turn of events. The ending was literally very unexpected. No one on Earth could even have the slightest idea of the end. It is basically based on a mystery which WEDNESDAY herself wants to solve and she solves it. I kinda felt bad that the real monster was ....... because Wednesday just had a moment with him. I am waiting for the next season to come and it's officially announced. It was teen stuff but if anyone has interest in mystery and typical high school story this is your best show to watch.  WORTH WATCHING!!!!!!!!!",2,negative
"Wednesday joins school and is instantly great at everything, there is no heartless evil, no confrontation, there is just a mild competitiveness with the other children.... Previous incarnations of Wednesday would have tortured the room mate on the first day, turned psychiatrist mad and have burnt down the school... the actor looks the part and speaks amazingly but the character is simply just a mildly gothic person at school, nothing more  If they are going to put out other seasons, they need to find better writers to make it more ruthless... have better one-line come-backs and less meaningless conversations to prove how Wednesday is better than other characters... lose the silly love interests and have consequences for people who challenge Wednesday.",7,neutral

"Ok, so it's Star Wars, expect more plot holes then a script actually written on Swiss cheese. But, it's written, directed and crafted with so much love for the Star Wars universe that it's just impossible not to love. Almost every episode contains some nod or other to a book, film, cartoon or video game that you've already fallen in love with. The characterisation is so so, the script obvious, but don't we love that about SW? We don't watch, read or game the SW universe for it's Shakespeare like pros or it's Kafkaesque qualities, we love SW because it's plain freakin awesome. The Mandalorian is literally the best made for TV show EVER!",10,positive
"Most of the attention in season 3 seems to be on the back ground music and the Thailand setting .  Production Quality and attention to details for the back drops excellent .  But it's just so boring - sooo anticlimactic after season 1 and 2 .  My rating went from an easy 9 for the first two seasons to 4. Frustrating watch.  I've never been so hopeful for a season . It's a slow burn , but the burn is silly at this point if the viewer invested in so many episodes without any reward .  The acting is good and the characters were chosen well which makes it even more frustrating.  The hard points and lessons of the other two seasons are falling short for each repetitive episode of this season .",8,positive
"It's been a while since I came across a show that actually managed to deliver sharp and witty remarks in the spirit of dark humor and actually nail it!  If you enjoy dark humor, you are going to have a good time watching this.  Jenna Ortega really carries this whole show on her own.  From the way she delivers each line, to the facial expressions and the demeanor/body language. Everything is just hilariously well-executed. She is 10/10 in this show!  Her character also seems to exhibit some autistic traits which are also delivered in a believable and interesting fashion.  As far as the rest of the cast goes, there are some others that add to the enjoyment, like Emma Myers. Most of the other actors are at least slightly above average so they are not much of a nuisance and don't detract from the overall experience (except maybe for Uncle Fester who seems to belong in some B-level SNL skit).  The story could be better and some of the battles could also be longer and more interesting. The story and its resolution rate around 6/10 for me. A bit predictable and doesn't really reach its potential climax.  All in all, great and also fun watch! If you are hesitant, give it a try!",10,positive
"This is an amazing spin off of the original Addams Family. The visuals are amazing and it is one of the best Netflix shows. Jenna Ortega and Emma Meyers do an amazing job and made the show vivid and are one with their characters.  The script is a bit off somehow - it feels like it's a forced on the main characters. Side plots are not getting anywhere, and the characters have to act a certain way that is more focused on the story rather than their own motives.  I am also not entirely sold on the characters and portrayal of Morticia and Gomez - it is different than the original movies and story. There is no chemistry, and the characters' looks are off (based on the original description).  Nevertheless, if you don't compare and watch it as a show on it's own, it is a very good. I laughed, I broke down, it is overall a very entertaining series.",7,neutral
"I probably liked it more than it deserves but I did enjoy it a lot. Although CZJ looks the part, I thought she was terrible. The Gomez character could not have possibly been cast worse. He literally ruins the show for me. And fester was a terrible casting as well. I also didn't like thing. Of course I am comparing it to the cast from the movie, and nobody will be able to touch them in a million years, but these don't even come close. Again, Wednesday, knocks it out of the park and the rest of the cast besides her siblings do too. I'll definitely watch season 2 when it comes out. I just really hope they recast Gomez.",9,positive
"This is not a show I would normally pick. I was not an early adopter. After visiting Park City where the first few seasons are filmed we started to watch and it took a few episodes before I was hooked. If you are not convinced after one episode, give it some more time. It's worth it, I promise !  Yellowstone has the old school way of telling a story. There is a hero and the antagonist is clear to the viewer. For example the heroes/good guys drive Dodge ram and the bad guys drive Ford trucks. There are plenty of these kind of examples how the production emphasizes and makes a clear line between the good and the bad.",7,neutral
"Finally we have something totally new from Star Wars! Yet it has a familiar feel that just settles you into its world straight away.  George Lucas always did say Star Wars was an amalgamation of eastern and western culture. The Jedi/Sith clearly influenced by the samurai and Buddhism and the criminal underworld/bounty hunters influenced by the old west.  Here the Western vibes are off the chart and I'm loving it! This is the old school Star Wars we glimpsed throughout the original trilogy in places like the Mos Eisley Cantina, Fett's pursuit of Solo and Jabba's palace.  There are countless throwbacks already in the first two episodes but they're done tastefully and in a way that drives the story forward. Expanding upon idea we've only ever had a slight glimpse of in the past and brining in new concepts we had yet to see in a live action Star Wars project.  Pascal so far has done an amazing job as the titular Mandalorian and that's no mean feat with a helmet on at all times! I hope this series will explore the mythology and post Clone Wars/Empire history of the Mandalorians as there so much we don't know about them still.  The support cast have so far been great too. The atmosphere of the show is spot on. The effects are superb with a perfect blend of practical and CGI used in the right places so far. It really does look like a Star Wars movie! It definitely has a Rogue One-like visual vibe to it. Which, in my opinion, is no bad thing.  The episodes are quite short compared to other contemporary shows and I have seen a lot of negative comments about this aspect of the show. However I feel so far the episodes have been very well balanced and haven't went off on meandering tangents (unlike the prequels and even more so the sequels). It does remind me somewhat of the Clone Wars animated series - short instalments but to the point and we'll presented. However that may not come as a surprise since Dave Filoni is involved in both shows.  Perhaps the modern world is too used to online shows being presented in a ""series dump"" format where all episodes become available at once. I grew up in the 80s and part of the excitement of a serialised show was having to wait to the following week to see the next instalment! We didn't have any alternative back then. However we used that week to get excited for the next episode and talk to our friends about what we think might happen and wait in anticipation to see if we were right. Maybe we all need to get used to that again?  I'm glad Disney has decided to go back to a scheduled release format for this show as I think it really enhances the old school feel of it all. Plus it means that people who don't have the ability to binge watch the whole series aren't at a disadvantage on social media for spoilers etc.",10,positive
"I just found out that Yellowstone was canceled, not ending but canceled? Just when I just binged the whole show and now waiting for the last six episodes to air! It's such a fantastic show, although Kelly Reilly' a character is a bit rough, but it's like I hate her and love her at the same time, she was made for that role! Heck the whole cast is superb, none of them are just okay, they are all excellent! This show needed at least one more season to fulfill the story, as it is now it will just seem cut off and unfinished, so I hope the last six episodes do the ending of the show justice! Bye Yellowstone!!",10,positive

All characters on point and especially the thai songs hyped the scenes well i love it when i watch the show with earphones. Sounds wonderful ???? plus, motion picture and the hotel, the view is perfect!!! ????????all first episode it's make me feel excited and can't wait for the other one (1 episode per week kinda too little for me now ??) on top of that I'm surprised to witness Lisa on her first acting debut. She's absolutely incredible for the first ep and her co-star as well. The cast in this show is truly nailed it ????",9,positive

I didn't think this was going to be any good so I kept skipping it. Them one night I clicked on the 1st season episode 1 I was hooked when I saw Jennifer Coolidge I was hooked. Season 1 was so good I binged the entire 2 Seasons. Then Season 2 I didn't expect to see Jennifer Coolidge in season 2. I thought it was going to be a whole new story line with all new cast. The story with Jennifer Coolidge character continued. This is the best show I have seen in a long time. I keep rewatching both seasons. You cannot judge a book by the cover or the name. You have to watch this. At first Season 2 started off slow but omg when you find out what these gays are up to with Jennifer Coolidge character it's insane. This show is insanely good. Give it a try you won't regret it. It sucks you in. You will end up binge watching both seasons. Theo James is not the good guy in this season 2. I was hoping my Theo James was gonna be a good guy. But it's so good. All the different stories going on at once it's like a modern day soap Oprah. It's crazy crazy crazy in a wonderful way. I tip my hats to the writers and all the stars. The ones I didn't know I became a fan of all of them. Many surprises. Don't want to spoil it by giving away anything. But I knew Jennifer Coolidge husband was no good. It was too good to be true. At first I liked him. But in season 2 you will hate him. It kills me what the gays did to Jennifer Coolidge character !!! That's it I'm done I cannot wait for Season 3. I cannot wait to see what they come up with.  I hope Tanya comes back for season 3 even if it's just a ghost but he could back it up and say she actually survived but I doubt it. They could go backwards in life if they want to keep Tanya. That's the only way he could keep Jennifer Coolidge in the upcoming seasons is to back up the story to her past. I know there is no way that Mike White is not going to keep Jennifer Coolidge in the entire upcoming seasons. Is to go backwards. I just cannot see Mike white not giving us a surprise he lives Jennifer Coolidge they are best friends. She will be a ghost or he will go backwards in time. To show her parents possibly. Just a theory. I pray she is not done. Because Jennifer Coolidge is the only reason I watched season 2. She carried this entire project. Season 2 had the worst actors. I liked the hotel staff and the prostitutes more than the main cast. Jennifer Coolidge carried them all. The gay mafia they were pretty good also.,9,positive

The series tells the story of the 1920s when Birmingham was in space There are two First and Second World Wars.

"If this show is a food, it would be medium rare steak, not complex, not too long, juicy and not too many seasoning involve, just right. Alan Ritchson is Jack Reacher. What i love about the show is the main character who is as close as it can get to the book. The story is good, not masterpiece level but good enough for starter season. No BS agenda being push down our throat like current generic tv shows.  Suggestion for next season would be only to add more action and a little bit complexity to the story with more twist.  Ps: take away the smile, i think he is fit to play The Punisher, he got the size and intimidating stare, i bet skull vest would look good on him.",8,positive
"I generally don't like action series. But reacher is just great. It has good source material and Alan. If i close my eyes, that's what i look like in my mind. He makes the whole thing work!  It's just an awesome guy doing awesome things all the damn time, with a good storyline to back it up. And when you think it doesn't get more awesome. It does in the next scene, like a compounding awesomeness plot twist. I just can't find a better word than awesome. It is the awesomest description of itself.  I honestly have not read the books yet, even though i bought some. But having seen the series first, i am worried it will not be the same, because Alan is just such a good fit for the character and the action is so well done, i am not sure i could imagine it better. I always read the books first, if an interesting series or movie is published based on a book. Books are just better. This seems to be the exception. Although, maybe i should actually read a reacher book. But hell, this just has me smiling like a fool for 8 episodes and there is scarcely anything that can do that... So let's keep it going please!",5,neutral
"I thoroughly enjoyed this series, even if I'm probably 3 decades past the target audience. Jenna Ortega does a fantastic turn as an angsty teenage Wednesday Addams. Like all good Tim Burton heroines, she manages to perfectly encapsulate a zealous thirst for the macabre and doe-eyed vulnerability in equal measure. The female cast members were all particularly strong, although the overly expansive cast left most characters woefully underdeveloped outside of a couple core relationships.  The story is a whodunit mystery that most will likely figure out, but I thought the quirky journey and characters made up for the predictability of the plot. Overall, it felt similar to Stranger Things as a homage to past shows, rather than being purely derivative. To me, it seemed like some strange love child of Teen Wolf and Daria... but not in a bad way! An enjoyable weekend watch.",10,positive
"Peaky Blinders sees a wonderfully aesthetic show that slowly throughout the seasons appears to sacrifice more of its depth for said aesthetics.  This show's most interesting character remains the iconic Thomas Shelby, a war-torn man and a career criminal of genius intellect and disturbing psyche. The lead is excellently acted by Cillian Murphy who, through sheer verbal and non-verbal means, manages to mythologise the character of Tommy into something more, despite a lack of an established character arc.  Most characters besides Tommy have charisma but lack layers. Character arcs that appear to be set tend to be overlooked, awkwardly ignored, and in worst cases retconned during the show. The dialogue is poetic and engaging, but feels shallow and forced at times.  Season 1 sees a haunting portrayal of a criminal world haunted by a brutal war. Crime is not glorified but lamented upon, and the dirty side of that life is showcased constantly. This, however, slowly shifts throughout the show when music and montages backed by setpieces take a foreground instead of character development and moral ambiguity. The soundtrack does help set the tone for many scenes, and immerses the viewer into the murky waters of Birmingham.",2,negative
"Undeniably a great tv show; beautiful cinematography, amazing costume work, and superb acting. Henry Cavill as Geralt is everything! My only complaint is that the storyline is a bit chaotic, the show jumps around and goes off on tangents, and it's hard to keep up. However, the main storyline is compelling, the characters are well developed, and I can't wait for more!",9,positive
"I've never written a review in my life. After seeing this and then looking for more information about it, I came across IMDb and instead of finding intelligent reviews from intelligent people, I find a few that scream of ignorance.  It is pretty easy to understand why.  As the 20th century began, human evolution was at a turning point. Science fiction of the day predicted a future that was more enlightened, civilized and more intelligent. But as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction. A dumbing down of society began to occur. How did this happen? Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the smartest, the fastest, reproduced in greater numbers than the rest and in which the weakest or not-so-intelligent were culled, a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man, now began to favor different traits. Evolution began not to reward intelligence, but to coddle and save the weakest. With no natural predators to thin the herd, it began to simply reward those who reproduced the most, and left ""Intelligent Man and Woman"" to become an endangered species. One need not look far within these comments to see that in effect. It's not that hate which is shown in some of these reviews that is killing the world. I think that up to a certain point all of us possess some level of hate. It is not having the mental acuity or aptitude to recognize it within ourselves, and to not let ourselves be led by it. Some of these so-called reviews are downright scary when you stop to think that is the actual mentality of the person who wrote them. One guy decrying interracial couples and gays to the point of not watching a television program that has them. A woman who says this could not happen and in the next paragraph goes on to detail how it could happen, only not as Christianity. Who cares what it is called, if you admit it could happen?  As for this series itself, it is relevant. For now. In this time. More than ever.  Beyond that, it is beautifully filmed and acted.  Do not fall for the negative reviews of those fanatics and zealots who are purposefully trying to bring down the ratings and who are so lost they cannot even practice the very laws of a god they are trying to defend.  This series is a masterpiece.",10,positive
"I finally broke down and watched this series the same week that President Donald Trump incited his rally mob to verbally attack four American women of color. ""The Handmaid's Tale"" is most effective when it shows how easily a democracy can devolve down the slippery slope to a neo-Fascist society. At times, it's hard to separate fact from fiction. Having lived in Massachusetts, it's setting in Boston is particularly unnerving. This series is not entertainment, it's a warning for citizens to stay awake and aware.",10,positive
The first few episodes filled me with hope but then the series fell off a cliff and had some laughably bad episodes in the middle the final 2 episodes redeemed the series somewhat again and left it in a good place for an improved second series. It felt quite often that the budget was extremely low especially in certain episodes and the supporting cast at times were absolutely awful. It's still worth watching as a Star Wars fan but I hope their standards improve for future Star Wars series.,10,positive
"...and the audience rating is extremely misleading. At least if you're not a hardcore fan of the eponymous books and/or video games. The first episode follows up a brief action shot with 30 minutes of spoken exposition. There is an unironic scene where the main character recites his backstory to a horse. If all this ""tell, don't show"" were at least slightly interesting, but it all seems incredibly dry and far-fetched. Names of fictional places are dropped like confetti. Random people enter the stage and recount made-up historical events like D&D-playing high schoolers.  Finally, the main character gets to prove his martial skill again and it looks like a scene straight from a video game. Fast dolly shots and slow-mo sequences capture every gruesome death in gut-churning detail. I'm can stomach a fair amount of violence, even cheesy and overly gory violence à la 300 or Spartacus. But this is just too ridiculous. It feels like watching a Twitch stream without the webcam commentary. If you're as unfamiliar with the source material as I am, you might want to give this clunker a wide berth.",6,neutral
"Entertaining story. Kinda like reading the old Marvel comics where comic lines are inserted for dramatic effect. All the bad guys are really bad, but Reacher and crew are super powerful and always able to break the code, outsmart the crooked, and knock out the assassins.  The acting is pretty wooden but it's not written with any awards in mind. Reacher is the head of a crew of former ""super MPs"" who come back together when a number of former colleagues are being killed.  This leads to a complicated mission that involves defense contractors, lots of assassins that die when they meet up with Reacher, and assorted other crooks.  Here's the plus side. It somehow works as long as you can suspend some reality and just enjoy reading the comic book.",10,positive
"Two episodes in and the show is already a classic in terms of acting, visuals, soundtrack, etc. It's so faithful to the source material, and as a die hard fan of the game, the nostalgia hits hard.  Some reviews say that the third episode is one of the (if not the) best of the series even though it's probably the episode that will derive from the original story the most.  I'm really glad that we have access to much more content in the story that didn't make it through the original game, such as the background relationship between Bill & Frank, Ellie's mom, etc...  The visuals are stunning, each scene is a chef's kiss of visual and practical effects, and the clickers feel so real it's almost frightening!",4,negative
"I came to the series because of the Tiktok trend of the famous dance from the fourth episode, and I discovered a promising actress!  As someone born in the 80's who knows the Addams family, I didn't feel a special connection to the original concept and it felt like a completely new concept to me, there is a bit of a feeling that you are watching Harry Potter. The script is great for teenagers and feels entertaining for a more mature audience.  Many times during the series, the script became forced to connect to places that probably wanted to take the series, I have all kinds of unresolved parts along the way. I didn't feel enough tension in most of the episodes, and at some point you start to realize that anything can happen in Wednesday's favor, which is a shame. Especially in the last two episodes.  It's a shame they didn't choose a successful enough cast of actors like Jenna and of course the goddess Catherine Zeta Jones.",9,positive

I can't wait for Season 2. Hopefully we'll see a few more family member cameos next season? Seeing as how much it has been viewed and the positive response I can't imagine we won't see a second season. As much as I like Rob Zombies work, I enjoyed Wednesday so much more than the new Munsters. Then again I was always partial to the Addams Family over the Munsters. Tim Burton was the perfect pick to do this series. Home run.",8,positive
"UPDATE Season 2 of Reacher fixed all or most of my issues with Season 1, namely a lead actor with no affect or dynamism.  One immediately sees the difference in how the Reacher character is portrayed in Season 2. He's grimier, more serious and more intense. He actually seems to be acting, unlike most of Season 1.  Bravo. Thoroughly enjoyed Season 2.  ORIGINAL REVIEW I truly wish I could just 'go with it' as so many suggest when it comes to the very weak acting (Richter only) and somewhat weakish writing. I have managed to get through about 7 episodes of the first season, but every time the camera turns to Richter it usually results in a flat response from me --- because he does flat acting.  Finally, after watching the 7th episode, I realized I was wasting my time hoping for Reacher to turn into an exciting series. I truly liked Tom Cruise in the Reacher film role. He brought dynamism and cleverness to the role. Richter, on the other hand, brings nothing to the table, acting wise. It's hard to understand who was advising him on this.  I'm out.",10,positive
"Truth be told I was really nervous about this one. This game is so dearly to me. I think it is one of, if not the best told story in a game ever.  But episode one delivered and beyond. It brought me back to the game so many years ago and they nailed it.  I was skeptical for the role of Joel and Ellie, but both of them are doing an excellent job so far. Joel has an intensity that I wasn't sure this actor could deliver and that is crucial for making the story work. Alright, Ellie, we all lived so many hours with this character that you have a certain image in your head about who to play the role. And I don't know who else could do it. We have to see how she holds up through the story but high hopes none the less.  If the serie can hold this level of accuracy then damn, we are in for a treat!  Great job guys, make us proud, till the last of us!",10,positive
Finally Jack Reacher as he should be. Alan Ritchson absolutely nails the character. I binge watched the series. This is Lee Child's story played by someone who fits the part. Here's hoping we see much more of this Reacher.,6,neutral
"I haven't played the game - though I was aware of it. I was still really looking forward to this screen adaption. Anything with zombies in it, and I'm excited. I wanted to wait till at least after watching the second episode before leaving a review, reason being that I didn't want it to be a case of the first episode being a fluke.  The first episode was brilliant - it had me right on the edge of my seat and engrossed from the moment it started. I was invested in the characters and there was no fault to be placed anywhere.. By the end of the first episode I was definitely left wanting more. I was especially excited to see that Anna Torv from Mind Hunter was in it playing Tess.  The second episode also did not disappoint. The dynamic between Ellie (Ramsey) and Joel (Pascal) is captivating. I am learning also not to get too attached to anyone along the process.  I am definitely in the for the long haul and keen to see how the storyline develops and watch the relationship between Ellie and Joel develop more into a father and daughter type role.  This show is definitely worth a watch.  I hope that they know when to end it though, and don't keep it churning for season after season like The Walking Dead.",9,positive
"Do I watch a lot of shows for the sake of watching everything that comes out.. sure... do they draw me in like this one... every rearly.. by season 2 the depth of character development is at a premium.. Kevin Costner is at his brilliant best, but the support he has around him is what makes this show so complex and unmissable.. Week by week viewing yet I find my self going back to watch again as a movie length offering... excited for more!!",10,positive

"Because of this season 6 I had to change my rating. 3 episodes in and we can already feel Season 6 will be an absolutely disgrace. Super boring and useless characters having way too much screen time. Such a pity, this was one of my favorite shows. BBC doing the same thing they did to Endeavor. Oh well...",10,positive
"The first episode was disturbing when I found out how a Handmaid was used, very disturbing. But I'm so glad I stuck with the show. It is very well done, production, directing, all of the actors were phenomenal, but Elizabeth Moss as June was pure perfection. The state of the USA is in a very disturbing place at the moment. Our POTUS is misogynistic rapist, pedophile, CRIMINAL AT LARGE. It's awful, but not one tenth as awful as the show. I was impressed with the role changes between June and Serena. It helped me with our current situation and the notion that there is good in everyone, some just take longer than others to reveal their own good.",7,neutral
This show does nothing in terms of character development or even story wise. I cannot understand why this is highly rated. It reminds me of the magic formula: Just make some stuff happen that is irrelevant to the character in the long run. Then fix it before the end of the episode and your start and end is exactly the same. Now repeat the same stuff over and over. This is nothing more than fan-service by putting a known character or item or location in there but does nothing story or character-wise.,3,negative
"Among all the other sludge that has been released on the movie and tv-show front over the past few years, Wednesday is definately refreshing.  It's far from ""perfect"", with some strange character choices, repeating plot points, and somewhat plotholes, but overall I enjoyed it.  I'm 36 years old now, so I'm probably not the intended demographic, but even for me it was quite decent.  16 year old me would probably give this show a 9 or maybe even 10 rating.  I don't know what else to write, need to fill up some more characters in order to post this. Almost there. Just a few more. There we go..now.",10,positive
"One of the best shows out there, season 2 might be even better than season 1 10/10 for sur! For a third season I need an even better cast (like that's possible) with a lot of divers characters and gay characters ofc. I gotta keep writing but please resurect Tanya no matter how, she needs to be on all of the season, if her sister was to show up miss Jennifer tilly will be perfect. Lucia was my favorite character on season 2 she was hot, sweet and knew what she was doing will all those whites rich men who only saw her as a sex symbol. Portia was also great and the whole gay storyline was very well done and funny!  What are you waiting for? Go watch this amazing satire of the society!",10,positive
"If you want the show to be the exact same as the game. Play the game again. This show and everyone behind it are genius, they keep you on your toes. Acting is incredible (props to casting), do the actors look a little different than the game characters? Yeah. Should that matter? No. The point is that the actors embody their characters perfectly and sure the story deviates a bit here and there bc why would you want to know exactly what happens and what's said in every episode? Where's the fun and excitement in that. I'd skip the show and play the game again if that's what they did.but they didn't so WATCH IT. You won't regret it. First show in a while I've been excited about every week. Ps episode 4 is iconic and amazing. My jaw was dropped the ENTIRE time.",10,positive
"It is a bit hard to pinpoint exactly what I love about this and what makes it amazing. But I will give it a try.  Visually this is a stunning series to watch. Tim found the perfect balance of creating a world that pulls you in and creates a good feeling. I love it and can't stop admiring the choice of cars, the clothes and other details. Master class.  I really enjoyed the whole cast of this. There is something to be said to have the ability to pick people that seem to belong together. Finding people that will contrast well with the Adam's family and make it seem natural can't be easy but it is done exceptionally well here. The only character I was not extremally happy with was Uncle Fester, something did not fit the cast with his style. On the other hand, he did not have a lot of air time.  Bottom line is that this is among Tim Burton's best work in my opinion. I am sure it is not the critics favourite because there usually is a detachment between what people actually think is good vs what some jaded ""professionals"" think is deep and boring enough to be a master piece.  All in all, It has the same magical feel I had watching some of the great shows as a kid.",10,positive
"This show has made me and my husband fall (deeper) in love with Star Wars all over again.  Every episode is exciting to watch. The stories/adventures of the Mandalorian and baby yoda child really keep you on the edge of your seat and are very captivating, enthralling, entertaining, and nail-biting good.  Each episode always kicks off with a heartbeating intro accompanied by a fantastic original score of music that makes you feel so excited for what is to come. The music is genius-ly composed and brilliantly enhances the drama/action of every scene.  The characters. I believe one of the main reasons this series is so successful is because of how like-able the main characters are. The Mandalorian and Baby Yoda are so easy to fall in love with and care about (thanks to great casting choice of Pedro Pascal and his wonderful take on the character). All the other characters have lived up to original Star Wars quality.  I was sad when Season 2 came to an end (a bit of a dramatic end if you will), and am not sure how I will be able to wait a whole nother year for Season 3.  Keep up the good work, Mandalorian production team! You made 2020 a little better :)",10,positive
"What can I compare this Show with? GOT? What else? We've got nothing about Magic and Beast! And in my opinion, The Witcher is Better than Game of Thrones (up to now). And yes, it's not perfect, because Script Writers could do a better job, but they didn't because of their Lack of Talent. And now I can only pray and hope for the 2nd decent enough season.",6,neutral
"I stopped to watch Star Wars in 2002, ""Attack of the Clones"" was the latest movie of the saga for me, and I hated it. For me that was not anymore the big cult movie that was made in the 80s. When ""The Mandalorian"" was announced, I didn't want to watch it, but after reading many positive reviews and being pushed from a friend, I decided to give it a shot. Finally, after years, I am watching a real Star Wars production, it remember a lot the original movies, it feels like it. I love locations, I love characters, I love costumes and the Mandalorian is a badass. I am so happy that someone actually listened to fans and decided to create something authentic.",9,positive
"'Lolita' is a 1955 novel written by Russian-American novelist Vladimir Nabokov. Nabokov set out to write a beautiful piece of literature but on a subject that was immoral and deplorable. The reader is thrown into a state of cognitive dissonance. It's great novel but....but.....  'Yellowstone' has a similar effect. Viewers are presented with a stunning aesthetic and seduced by the cowboy myth. But the family at the centre of the story are ultimately corrupt, vile murderers. Yet we are expected to sympathise and cheer them on. It's not unlike another popular series, 'Succession', but on horseback. However, while the family in 'Succession' are more clearly ugly, the Duttons and their entourage are held up as a shining example of America as 'the land of the free and the home of the brave'. It's a terrifically manipulative series.",8,positive
"I don't understand Cavill's characterisation - particularly that affected voice constantly forced to be deeper and grottier, when we all know that it's Henry's natural voice. It is distracting to say the least. Also found the direction lacking throughout - I'm all for stories that jump back and forth in time to let the viewer piece the puzzle as the episodes progress but in this instance it is delivered inconsistently and without adding anything to the drama of the storyline.",10,positive
"The lead - i've never had any feelings about him, because he's never convinced me otherwise... He has always acted like a bulldozer.. But i have to say that I went into this expecting to only see one episode.. well, I was wrong... he actually does a pretty great job in this series, and i recommend people to give it a chance... I normally dont like 99% of the bs that is getting made, but this is alright.  Also, I am batman.",10,positive
"After the disappointment of GOT Season 8, we really needed something like the Witcher to fill that void. It has amazing storyline, powerful characters and the right mix of fantasy and adventure. A must watch ! ;)",2,negative
"Went through the whole first season, here's what I got (no spoilers):  There is an obvious and deliberate through story. I would call this more of a mini series instead of just a series. Without spoilers, I did guess the main end reveal in the very first episode.  The production design is awesome and I believe it was only the first couple of episodes that Tim Burton directed and it showed. That is what I gave the 6/10 for. Had it not been for that I would have given the first season a 4. Here's the problem; the entire through-plot could have been any series, any characters, any time and place, and anywhere. The plot has nothing inherently specific to do with the Adams family I know from the television series and the movie in the 90s. It's so random. The entire plot could service a western, could have been an episode of magnum PI, could have been a movie about a cult, or could have been an episode of saved by the bell. That's my main problem with this series. It felt like someone submitted a story concept with outlines to Hollywood, then shelved it, then attached the Adams family to it at a letter date, changed some character specific plot devices and called it a day.  The series is nice to watch, is gorgeous, and has serviceable acting. The Wednesday characters seems like she is on the bleeding edge of straying from character type and just being a normal trope that progresses the plot as described above. I would like to see Jenna Ortega is a few more things before attributing her performance as unintentionally wooden. It's the same problem with Brent Spiner playing data in Star Trek TNG, is he good at playing a robot, or just a good actor in general?  The roommate is useless and does nothing in the entire series except for the last moment. But she still had nothing to do with the series. You could have taken her out and nothing the driving the plot would have been sacrificed. There is absolutely no reason for Christina Ricci to be in this series other than fan service, she does nothing, although she gave me a little (fleeting) chuckle in the last episode.  Is it entertaining? Absolutely. If you're here for Christina Ricci then skip it, if you're here for the Adams family, skip it, if you're here for rehashed tropes of Harry Potter, twilight, and stranger things, all a lot better and more original source material, then you're good.",6,neutral
"My only criticism is the casting of Gomez Adams is god awful ?? his look his acting is mediocre and it distracts away from the scenes and does not match Catherine Zeta. Sorry Jenna dominates the role. She keeps it in character and I can see how much she's grown as an actress since her Disney days. She's a pleasure to watch. The writing rocks, Suspenseful episodes. Great to see Christina Ricci, she's still a stellar actor. The story line gets into where they all came from with a theatrical approach. I recommend this series to adults, it's not just for the young. In fact it's a little scary for little kids in my opinion.",1,negative

This isn't just a breakthrough video game adaptation. THIS IS A GENIUS SHOW!  Poignant, violent, joyous and exhilarating all at once.  The Last of Us is the best video game adaptation of all time.

"I can't get enough of Yellowstone! Watching Kevin Costner as John Dutton, defending his ranch with grit and heart, totally draws me in. I love how the show mixes intense drama with the jaw-dropping beauty of Montana-I'm hooked from the start. The writing keeps me on edge, with twists that hit hard and characters I care about more each season. I feel the tension of loyalty and betrayal right alongside them. It's like stepping into a modern Wild West, and I'm always eager for the next episode-this show's a total thrill ride! The Dutton family's saga feels so real, I'm invested. The supporting cast, like Rip and Beth, adds such depth-I'm obsessed!",9,positive
"The opinions expressed in the negative reviews are ridiculous for the most part. The amount of reviews complaining about the ""lack of realism"" of situations, the law, and characters seemingly don't understand that TV shows and movies are meant to be an escape from ""reality"". Also, not every show is pushing a political agenda and the people complaining about it are the same people that get offended if you call someone the wrong pronoun.  Relax and don't overthink this show. It's got a good story and beautiful cinematic filming. People are too critical and too soft at the same time. In hindsight, my opinion ultimately doesn't matter either.",10,positive
"The cast is an unusually talented group of young actors, given the truly admirable job they deliver at their relatively young age, can't wait to see how they perform as they mature with additional experience. The story becomes overwrought and rather foolishly convoluted, which is too bad, because it ultimately trivializes a well-crafted series; still, worth watching. But probably would have benefitted from a few less episodes, and most certainly doesn't warrant another season with more of the same. The relationship to the original A. F. characters is minimal, at best, if that's what you're looking for, this series will likely disappoint.",10,positive
"The 8 episode show gives you insight on what Wednesday Addams life is like in High School. The mix of combined spooky vibes, character portrayal and mystery really makes you want to watch all 8 episodes in one sitting. I absolutely loved this series, I think Jenna Ortega did a phenomenal job of portraying the iconic Wednesday we all love. She gave an authentic depiction of the character as she grows up. The setting and plot were perfect, you really get attached to the characters and the plot of the series. If you want to watch a really good, funny, mysterious binge worthy show, I highly recommend.",9,positive

"Andor is a frustrating watch, particularly as Season 2 is progressing.  It is Compellingly Boring!  By this, I mean that some of the plot is absolutely compelling and among the best Star Wars there is, yet some of it is frustratingly dull, unnecessary and, yes, boring.  I'm a fan of slow burn shows like Better Call Saul, so it's not that I can't take slow moving shows that build characters.  However, 2 and a half seasons in, it's a real mixed bag. This far into any drama series, viewers should really care about the main characters, yet I've really not warmed to the central pairing of Cassian and Bix, despite the best efforts of the actors. The plot-lines around them just aren't strong enough and maybe the chemistry isn't really there between the actors. Compare that to Rogue One, where the plot really made me care for the fate of Cassian and Jyn and they had much better chemistry as actors, IMO.  Kleya is the best character IMO, every scene she's in is intriguing. Luthen is great too. The machinations of the Empire are generally fascinating. Mon Mothma is brilliantly played by Genevieve O'Reilly. Some of the scenes she's in are excellent and the sets and costumes look fabulous, but the plot doesn't always matches her talents.  Sadly, Cassian's arc disappoints most and that's the weakest part of the show, which is odd, because he's the main character!  I'm also disappointed in the soundtrack, which is soulless really, no memorable music whatsoever. It almost could be AI generated!  Nonetheless, I'm still hooked on the show, because the compelling plot lines just about do enough to compensate for the boring ones!",9,positive
"Watched it all in one sitting, loved it. The dark and witty one liners were so true to the Addams Family I grew up with, I just wanted more of them! Which is meant as a compliment not a criticism. I could see the Tim Burton in this but it isn't as glaringly obvious as I expected it to be. I would have like more of the weird and twisted moments Burton is known for (I'm thinking Beetlejuice, even Batman (like Batman returns, the Penguin always really freaked me out...anyway!)) The relationships between characters are well defined, which along with the plot, keeps you engaged. Really hope they make another season, and soon!",9,positive
"Just binged the first 5 episodes day 1 and had to force myself away. A great reinvention of the character in a unique modern world crafted by the likes of Tim Burton and Danny Elfman with the modern Scream Queen Jenna Ortega at the lead.  It was a fresh new take on wildly beloved character I love the fact that it stayed true to the original story however, it gave new life to Wednesday and a NEW storyline. It's not a reimagining of The Addams Family, it is truly Wednesday's story!! The school, the cast and the plot are absolutely delightful. Tim Burton is a genius and I am 100% ready for a season 2.",6,neutral
"Great casting and excellent action when it actually occurs. More holes in script than a Swiss cheese factory. To the point that it's extremely distracting. The analysing of people without any basis, the walking to people's houses without having been there before, the 5ft lads giving him a proper fight. It really does go on and on. It's so weak the writing and lack of background.",3,negative

"Henry Cavill is the only reason this series isn't total garbage. So 2/10.  Nearly everyone else of the cast is a catastrophe.  Everything you could have done wrong compared to the books or the games, the did worse than wrong.  The whole plotline according to the books is changed to include a bunch of boring and useless side charakters, just to satisfy the wokness.  They try to meme Game of Thrones but it's not.  They change the personality of the main charakters to fit in there wierd world.  The first season ist just not good. Something between 5/10 - 6/10.  The second season was pretty worse. With alot of unfitting slapstick comedy. 3/10.  The third season suprised me by getting worse than the one before. 1/10.  Conclusion: When you got a decent game to copy and a formidable book to take your ideas from, use it.  If not ... create something like this.",10,positive
"Wednesday is a series that takes us on a journey through the teenage years of the iconic character, Wednesday Addams. The show, which debuted in 2022, is a blend of fantasy, comedy, and crime, with a plot that revolves around Wednesday's attempts to master her psychic abilities, solve a supernatural mystery, and navigate her new life at Nevermore Academy.  The series is particularly appealing to a younger audience, with its focus on teenage storytelling and the theme of outcasts.  The first half of the series is particularly engaging, with a stronger plot and theme development. However, some of the later episodes tend to repeat certain elements, which can feel a bit redundant. Jenna Ortega's portrayal of Wednesday Addams is commendable, capturing the essence of the character perfectly. The series also explores the theme of embracing one's differences, a message that resonates with teenagers. However, the series is not without its flaws.  The plot, while intriguing, can sometimes feel a bit forced, especially in the later episodes. The series also deviates from the original Addams Family's focus on family unity, which might disappoint some fans. Despite these shortcomings, ""Wednesday"" is a worthwhile watch, especially for fans of the Addams Family and young adults looking for a series that combines mystery, supernatural elements, and teenage drama.  It's a solid 7 out of 10, with its unique take on a beloved character and a plot that, while occasionally repetitive, offers enough intrigue to keep viewers hooked.",10,positive
"This is a great, well acted, well directed adaptation of a book. This is a dystopian future that I don't feel ANYONE wants to see, experience or live in real life. My wife and I love the show because it is of the highest quality in almost every aspect. If anyone thinks that our current, real society is close to this (United States) then you have serious issues. The thing I find fascinating is reviews on here fail to look at other parts of the world and how women are treated. Think about where on the globe that can be. Think about what countries rule with an iron fist of religion. It's definitely not the US. Is the US perfect? Of course not. Why can't we just enjoy a show of extreme quality and stop the ""well we're just an inch away from this right now"" garbage. Watch the show, enjoy it, marvel at the fantastic acting, directing and chill out. Jesus H Christ. Enjoy it, don't live it.",7,neutral
"Let me start off by saying that, I didn't find Jenna Ortega's performance impressive or outstanding. It's barely passable for the character of Wednesday Addams. Not sure, whether the critics praised her performance out of some charity or because of her face.  The story starts off with Wednesday taking a revenge on her brother's bullies. Seems like a harmless prank by a protective sister but, it isn't. She comes up with twisted ways to attack the people who upset her. Though the character of Wednesday Addams in reality is morbid and emotionally reserved. Ortega portrays it like she is psychotic by attacking anyone she doesn't like or upsets her. This isn't the actual portrayal of Wednesday Addams rather, a perversion.  Throughout the show, she turns out to as an oddball outcast as she should be for the role but, here lies the twist where, the inherent morbidity that comes with her role is reversed and she starts making friends.  While, we have such a profound entrance for Wednesday Addams at the beginning, I think the story writers ran out of ideas on what to do with her exactly and so, they decided to make it a murder mystery with Wednesday having inherited psychic powers from Morticia. So, now Wednesday is now a social reject with a Nancy Drew complex while having psychic powers...?? Talk about stretching the artistic freedom of story writers way beyond the necessity... I was stumped how this got a high rating at first then, I realised it was Jenna's pretty face that pushed up the rating rather than the story or her acting.  This is not suitable for 14 year olds even though it's rated as TV-14 with all the violence and Wednesday's psychotic behaviour. It tries to normalise sociopathic behaviour while passing it off as it's expected from Wednesday. While, in reality Wednesday's character has always been odd rather than psychotic.  I found it disturbing that this was given a TV-14 rating when, it can easily be a 18 years and above.",3,negative

Her most engaging and titillating performance thus far was when she pinched her boobs while attempting to arose her cold inattentive zombie husband. None of the characters are remotely likeable or relatable. It's all been about character development of very uninteresting people. All sad, unhappy and depressed. I have yet to laugh... The only reason I'm giving this a 3 star is merely for scenic Italy ????. Maybe something interesting may happen next week and surprise me. Or maybe not ...!",5,neutral
"Its a tough to watch tale and its dragged out so slowly, The characters seem to have become masochists as they plunge themselves back into torture. After several seasons I gave up watching as its just being dragged on far longer than needed to finish the story which feels like money grabbing by the makers. If they at least showed some history of the war as a way to pad out the story instead of just painfully slow paced story telling it might have helped. It might have been more interesting to see how the nuclear war panned out and see how the irradiated areas came about instead of it being glossed over.",8,positive
"WEDNESDAY (2022 - )was an excellent Tim Burton series inspired by the Addams Family. It centers around teenaged Wednesday Addams (Jenna Ortega) and her being sent to a school for outcasts and misfits. The series is a broody, angsty dark fantasy YA series with touches of Burton-esque comedy; a teen drama at times bordering on melodrama but filled with elements of paranormal mystery.  ""Follows Wednesday Addams' years as a student, when she attempts to master her emerging psychic ability, thwart a killing spree, and solve the mystery that embroiled her parents.""  Overall, this was a fun and entertaining series, with Jenna Ortega especially shining in the role of Wednesday Addams. At times the series suffers from dated and somewhat overused elements, (us against them, normies vs the outcasts etc. Which felt a bit cheesy as the series progressed) filled with plenty of teen angst and melodrama, as well as a bit heavily focused on the dating aspect, or who Wednesday will be interested in, but the show was well made and definitely a fun watch. A dark paranormal fantasy with Addams Family inspiration.",9,positive

"This is the greatest video game adaptation and ""zombie"" show ever made! Easily one of the best HBO series. I am a huge fan of the game, but to see it live in camera is amazing. The attention to detail, yet refreshing look is so good. My only issue is that there are only going to be 9 episodes! Please make more! Honestly, everyone, please watch this show and give it the love it deserves. The cast, especially Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal, are so good. They did a great job choosing the right cast. I was jumping up and down to see all the little details they nailed from the game. Anyone, gamer or just a new viewer, will love this show.",8,positive

"Good grief!!!!!! If the pilot episode is any indication, this will be a non-stop thrill ride. Normally, I will wait for most (if not all) of a season to drop before I begin watching, so that I can get a more immersive experience. The Last of Us may be TOO hair-raising to binge watch, and taking a break between episodes might be a good thing.  The video game that the series was based on was given life by creative director Neil Druckmann, who believed that storytelling had become secondary in the game industry and set out to create a rich narrative in The Last of Us. This source materiel provides a good basis for an action series.  Like ""The Walking Dead"", it takes place in a dystopian America after a fast moving global pandemic has wiped out the vast majority of the population, leaving the corpses reanimated by the parasite disease. The original video game was inspired by a BBC documentary that featured a killer fungi which invades the bodies of ants and can exercise basic control over the insect's motor functions. In the opening scene of the series pilot, an epidemiologist explains that his worst fear is an evolved fungus that is created via global warming.  So: the pilot was crazy good. It grabbed my attention within minutes and reeled me in deeper in every following scene. It appears that HBO spared no expense to bring the world of The Last of Us to life. It's been estimated that each episode costs between 10M and 15M, and the show's budget might even more than Game of Thrones. I can't wait for the next episode.",8,positive

I'm really struggling to filled the required characters for this review so I'm just writing random stuff, I'm so disappointed I can't even describe it, I had such high hopes about this series and it still might have a chance if the main character is taking some acting lessons.",10,positive
"I have to say most of the user ratings on IMDB are quite misleading. This is one of them . The storytelling is incoherent, it is messy. It is not about the virus , it is about how the relationship between a man who has lost his child and an immune teenage girl grows. But the story wanders here and there too frequently and loses the plot. If it is trying to be about more than this relationship, just dont attempt it, just focus on the girl and the man , you are nowhere close to getting it dear writers. The plot and the dialogues are absurd and funny sometimes, not realistic given the bacground. While watching this I remembered the episode in the walking dead about the two small girls which moved me deeply. This series is trying to evoke your emotions and appeal to your feelings, but the whole series did not even move as much as that single episode of the walking dead. 7 is for the acting, and the sets, make- up. It is a shame that much better series dont get the attention they deserve. I read how the Boardwalk Empire had to be hastily brough to end due to lack of enough audience and how hard time the Wire producers had to keep the show going. People I suppose are after content bungeable on popcorn , easy to digest, easy to follow without much cognitive effort. Unfortunately that does not leave us with much, but intelectually very hollow series and films. We just went through a global pandemic guys. Come on..",8,positive

"This series had potential with a great cast, however I absolutely hated every character. Every person was miserable which made me miserable watching. Thank goodness it started off as a ""who done it"" or I would have never continued the remaining episodes.",6,neutral
"As a Romani traveler I find the usage of the language in this show subpage but then again it's not many books on it and most families countries and towns have different dialects of it but it's Tickno Mala, tickno mean small or little and mala mean friend and or friendly, O beng is correct but O/oh is used as a filler word and it's not Romani, beng mean bad, evil, devil and down that line it goes.

"My gawd, this is just an amazing series. There are blockbuster movies that don't hold a candle to a single episode of Yellowstone. I hope they make many more seasons of this show with the same cast, crew, and writers at the helm. It is breathtakingly filmed, flawlessly written, and filled with one of the most amazing casts I have ever seen. Even the music is perfect. Just perfect.  Shows like this don't come around very often. It is definitely a must watch, and watch again and again. Game of Thrones gets 10 stars from me. This one would get 15 if I could give them. The only thing bad I can think of is some day, as all TV series do, this one will have to end.  My only complaint is the Monica character is so punished with traumatic events in her life it just gets old. They need to kill her off or write her out of the show so Kayce can actually have a decent life and storyline. Her constantly holding him back is like deflating a tire in the middle of a drag race. Just as you start getting into the path Kayce is on, Monica throws a monkey wrench in the works. They could do a spinnoff of Monica's character called ""The Woes of Monica"". In every episode she cries non-stop about something bad that has happened to her. Please, put a stop to this constant flow of traumatic events with Monica, or get rid of her.",10,positive
"Even though this show is not categorized ase horror, and I can understand that if you expect unnatural and bloody scenes, but to me it definitely has it's place in this genre as the whole series is just pure evil. Add to that the excellent soundtrack, maybe repetitive to some, but so efficient to create that dark evil ambiance. And than you have the cast. What to write else than that they are just brilliant. You can only feel with the main character, her anguish, her hope, her desperation. Credits to Elisabeth Moss for her brilliant acting. But also the rest of the cast, like Yvonne Strahovski and Joseph Fiennes, two characters that everybody will hate, and that's enterily due to their excellent performances and thanks to the writers of this show to bring the necessary twists and turns to make this one of my favorite shows. I binge watched the first two seasons in only a couple days, and apart from the last episode of season two that was slightly disappointing the rest just got me sitting at the edge of my seat. I can't wait for more seasons of this series, in the hope they are all as wicked and evil as the first two, and secretly with the hope something terrible will happen to The Waterfords...",6,neutral
"To start, I'm a huge fan of the games, playing them multiple times. To say i was nervous about it becoming a tv show is an understatement after all the failed adaptations from the past.  Only one episode in and i am incredibly impressed! I knew what was going to happen yet the emotions and dark connotations bled through the screen with sheer perfection.  Each actor is perfectly cast so far, even Ellie who i was a tad apprehensive about. Pedro Pascal goes from strength to strength in his career, he is Joel in every way.  As i said, only one episode down but this so far is perfection. I hope the show carries on like it has done so far, this could and most probably will be the next gem HBO uncovers!",8,positive
"It's the first time that I write a review, so don't expect too much from it. Just wanted to review this one since it's one of the best series I've seen in a long time. Love it!  I've already expected it to be good, since I'm a big Tim Burton fan, but it really exceeded my expectations. Big 10/10 this one! I really hope there comes a second season ??  The casting has been done outstandingly! Especially Jenna Ortega. I had never seen her play in another movie, but she nailed this one. I will keep an eye on her from now on!  Must see series for everybody who loves a mysterious thriller fantasy! Be prepared to get hooked once you start watching.",9,positive

The sounds, the music, the sets... it FEELS like Star Wars... and it's all SOOO good. And the 2nd season may have been better than the first. Thank you to everyone involved with this production!",4,negative
"This show is incredible and every character makes you care about them except one. I'll get to it. Kayce is the the guy you want to be, John is the father you ""kind of"" wanted, Monica is the wife you wish you had, Rip is the strict but grateful boss you wish you had, honestly Jamie is a good brother, Jimmy is that goofy best friend, Lloyd is that fatherly figure friend you have or may wish you have. But one character just sucks and it's Beth. I liked her the first season with her hardcore attitude and wits, but I am so over it by season four, everyone saying they wished Monica was written out of the show? Heeellll no, I almost want to skip all of Beth's scenes because they're so repetitive, fight with John, intense fight with Jamie, trying to be so badass but you're not fight with a boss, then loving Rip. Her character needs some development. But all in all it's a amazing show. Beth is why it brings me to an 8.",10,positive
The characters are perfectly imperfect and I love that because it shows how human they are. It also has the best photography I've ever seen.  I began seen It because Cillian Murphy is in it. But I also saw it because I like a lot violent TV and this one is one of the most violent that exist. It's definitely not for kids.  I recomendable it a lot It has beautiful acting and directing so you should definitely watch it.,10,positive
"This series feels like a good remake that does fall short of being in the same league as the source material.  There are a few things that were really good, for example the short introduction pieces that told more of a background story of how the cordyceps began to spread or how certain characters are the way they are. These are really well made and add to the story of the game.  Whenever the series stays faithful to the game, it is the closest to reaching the same heights. One example is the first episode, which is just as emotional as its corresponding part of the game.  Unfortunately, some other episodes or events deviate from the game in a way that makes scenes less impactful. Often these are small changes but they add up. Big events in the game are made less significant by almost glossing over them, changing the general mood of the scenes or by changing the scenery that was such an important part in the game.  Overall, this series is good. I suspect people who havent played the game might find it a little better (but they are missing the bonus of fan service). As someone who has played the game however, I can only say: This is an off-tune version of the game and therefore if you gave me the choice between the two, I would always pick the game. It is more impactful and rounded off.  Still, I enjoyed it, mainly for the backstory it provides and the times it does follow the game more closely. And it gave me a reason to play the game again.",10,positive

"Many similarities to the 60's western series, except this time the Barclays have transformed into the Duttons, a dark minded psychotic family with no morals, only money seems to matter. Barbara Stanwick has been replaced by Kevin Costner, a rancher who is willing to use his daughter's dark side to do her evil so that he can save his ranch. All in all, most of the characters in this series are people kids should never look up to as far as mentors go.  Don't get me wrong, it's an entertaining series. The acting is solid, the scenery is spectacular. I spent some time in Montana and watching it makes me ""homesick""  While The Big Valley May be too sugar coated, Yellowstone is the polar opposite. I love watching Kevin Costner act, he's gifted, good looking and charming.. I mean what man wouldn't want to be him. However John Dutton on the other hand, is not someone I would ever aspire to be.",9,positive

"The writing on this series is more than superb, sharp, sophisticated, I fail to find any other ways to kiss this shows bootiè (my own frenchefied version of ass yes) because it has rescued me from televisions current and worsening case of generic shallow syndrome, I wish I'd make my very limited vocabulary moist and flexible enough to reach it and serve its purpose. Seriously, all bubbly annoying kidding aside, I wouldn't be surprised if Mr. Burton had done all the writing, but I get a distinct feeling it's the two newcomers who have brought a refreshing new facelift, if you people will, to his nineties feature film version. Anyway, the acting it's top notch, production design it's all sound genuinely stylish and ..yes freaking awesome. And yes this rant is a ""nod"" to Wednesday's roomies character, which was done to perfection, not too raw, or cooked, just right. OMG I love it!",8,positive

"The plotting is simplistic, the dialog is embarrassing, the acting skills on display are modest at best. While it provides some interest with classic Star Wars iconography, the series is on par with Saturday morning live action of the 70s. I won't be surprised when the Sleestaks arrive to hiss and wave their arms at Mando, Xena Warrior Princess and Baby Yoda.",10,positive
"If you are looking for a star wars show that you can show your 13 year old kid, look no further. The characters have a clear good/evil alignment, the episodes are short and require not much thinking, and the music will tell you in every scene how you are supposed to feel. The bad guys are bad at shooting, but as soon as they turn to the good side they are marksmen. There is lots of plot armor to go around and the most of the ones dying have literally never shown their faces.  On the negative side there is e.g. that in the first few episodes Mando is hunting someone, and gets surprised by that someone and drops his blaster before having a fist fight. Time and time again. Even against animals. At many times it feels like they started with a computer game and turned it into a TV show. The power level of the characters change at random. In one scene a character is capable of killing ~40 enemies on his own, while being shot at. 10 minutes later there is no possible way that the same character can - with help from others - kill 15 enemies. The decisions that ppl take are sometimes ridiculous, but necessary for the plot to happen the way it does. The music is overwhelming and at times tries to turn a neutral scene into being suspenseful.",9,positive
"I just don't think Bella Ramsey really got Ellie's character. In the game, when Ellie says ""I don't need your help"" to Joel, there's this quiet sadness behind it-like she's trying to stay strong even though she's clearly hurting. But in the show, that same line just comes off as angry, without any of the vulnerability that made the moment so powerful.  And with Abby, what I loved about the game was how it totally flipped expectations. You see her and Joel's intense moment first, and only later do you understand her reasons. It was shocking but meaningful. The show kind of ruined that by giving everything away too early. It took the mystery and emotional punch out of it. Honestly, that feels like a writing issue more than anything else.",10,positive

"This show was really good, brilliant. Jenny Ortega and other cast members gave an outstanding performance. To see life through Wednesdays eyes and really having a better understanding of who she is, was great to see. I will say however i was disappointed in the casting choice for Gomez, Gomez is intense, vibrant, and loves intensly. Luis Guzmán is a great actor I loved him in shameless and other roles he has been in, but I do not believe he was suitable for the role of Gomez. His scenes were so off-putting. And I was disappointed, I hope moving forward with casting for Gomez they find someone who can live up to the great Raul Julia.",10,positive
"Ever since the Sequels and all the hate towards it Star Wars lost a lot of its true meaning. A story about making right choices in a galaxy far far away with complications that can change you completely. A story with a lot of humour, action and tragedy. The Mandalorian finally brings us back to those ideas. It's not a hugh story only for the sake of being hugh and epic without real necessity (looking at you Starkiller Base and Xyston-Class Star Destroyers). This series succeeded at making a faceless character with very little dialogue into a true character worthy of Star Wars and loved by fans.  As a life long fan of Star Wars this is a real gift.",10,positive
We too binge watched the 1st season and rated it very good ( 8 stars) with an excellent cast led by Costner. But after 4 episodes into season 2 (rated 4 stars) it evolved into a poor and unbelievable soap opera. Beth became particularly irksome and rancorous and her scenes with everyone particularly Jamie became unbearable.,9,positive
"This show has become the new GoT for me in that I start watching the minute it is available for streaming. Like and good zombie media the show is really about humanity and the choices we make in impossible situations. Everything about this show is excellent from the costumes, the editing, the camera work, and of course the acting and writing.  To truly appreciate the show, you have to play the games, not watch someone play them. The interactivity adds another layer of immersion which is bordering on traumatic. Both games for me were like Schindlers List as in they were all masterpieces but the experience was too difficult to repeat.  This live action adaptation perfectly captures what made the games great and I believe it has much to do with involving the incredible team that made the game. My hope is that this show will convince more people that games like the Last of Us and other games are art and among the greatest stories ever told.",10,positive
"The Witcher seems to have send a little too much time trying to fit in every possible little thing to make it such a cliche, and it is not working to their favor. It's confusing as to why they have chosen to bouillon the show in this odd way. (I'm trying to be vague, I do not want to spoil anything)  Also I had a really hard time understand if the show wanted to be serious or quirky-funny. There wasn't a clear line and I personally didn't feel like it was working....  To sum up, I watched the first episode and I'm not watching any others.",10,positive

"The show is purely what every Star Wars fan want from Lucas Films. It has its moment of laugh, fight, adventure and mystery. The good thing is the originality of the story without any interference from any previous Star Wars storyline.

I have spoken. ??",3,negative
"This show is one of the best series out there. Its like Sopranos in the 1920's. Cinematography is spot on, the writing, the visuals, the acting are all superb. The family values of the lead characters pulls in you and leaves you invested. The 50 minute running length per episode leaves you well satisfied. The only thing the writers could have done better, is not end this series after a season 6.",10,positive
"I waited to finish the whole season before I commit to writing anything about Andor. I always felt that it might slip at some point and go downhill but it never did. Unlike any other Star Wars universe series to date it did not focus on the force or the Jedi, but touched instead on a much more serious side of the Empire and the regular people living within its borders. It's a very mature story that might not appear to everyone especially the ones seeking fast paced combat and lots of space fights, but it connects very well with the atmosphere in Rogue One. Being as good as it is, the series come with certain compromises. It feels very distant from most of the Star Wars universe we've seen to date - there are very little non-humanoid aliens present if any. Most characters speak with British accent for some reason. If you don't know better you get the impression that the Empire was ran entirely by people from Earth. I get that their vision is supposed to match a certain other evil empire from our own history, but we're not the 70s when there was a lack of FX and lack of diversity in casting. It doesn't spoil it for me, but it's distracting. To make the whole thing even more ""Earthly"" I saw a lot of references to space ""coffee"" and ""cereal"" as if the universe far away has to be exactly like ours. Once again, those are minor distractions that don't decrease the value of the show. In conclusion, it's really refreshing to see that everything doesn't just resolve around Tatooine. My ranking would be somewhere on the same level with the Mandalorian and much better than anything else. I'm definitely looking forward to S2.",10,positive
"I've read all the books, and I'm fine with the story deviating here and there. It's a solid series and could be considered the American version of a James Bond character, maybe mixed with a little John Wayne and John McClane.  It would be great if the writing were to showcase more of Reacher's intellect. He's very smart in the books. The TV series focuses more on braun than brains, and the pendulum is swinging wildly that way in season 3.  I wish they would use age appropriate actors. For example, the college kid in season 3 looks almost middle aged. Fine acting, but I was bothered the whole time by how old he looked.  The storylines are formulaic and a bit predictable, but it sure is fun to watch Reacher set things right. The villains can be pretty one-dimensional, but to be fair, they are written that way in the books as well.  With just a few tweaks, this could move from an average series to a great one.",9,positive
"You just have to love it. Everything. From the cast, to the plot, the camerawork, absolutely everything! Wednesday is going to remain a great show for decades, that's for sure. Also, everybody loves Thing, it is a whole mood. So playful and funny! The morbid scenes are the right amount of frightening, you have laughter, crying, tension, love, hatred, teenage problems and more serious ones. It is quite inevitable not enjoying all kind of feelings mixed up armoniously. Everything is matching, making things that need to stand out to really catch your eye. It was expected to receive such a work of art coming from the well-known Tim Burton but this show exceeded expectations in the best ways possible!",7,neutral
"Do not waste time reading poor reviews. Obviously these are people not aware of the character created by Lee Child. Although Cruise handled the role well this is very close to the book's character. I watched and thought his dry quick wit was right on. Amazed shot in Canada yet captured a true sense of Georgia hospitality. Loved the Finley character played by Malcolm Goodwin however, please create glasses that don't look fake. Otherwise, clearly looking forward to more in season 2!!!",6,neutral
"It's not a 9 or a 10 or a 4 as most reviews indicate. I'm torn in giving this one a 6 or a 6.5.  Started off well but there's a lull after that and episode 2 is a disappointing filler that's why the premiere were 3 episodes. Episode 3 is by far the strongest so I'll continue watching. Heard that episode 5 will outdo episode 3 so can't wait for that.  Great production value, stylish and very retro-futuristic ala Star Wars but unfortunately the story is very predictable so far and it hasn't justify its own existence yet.  This is the best Disney+ original series to date IMHO although that's a low bar to clear.",10,positive
"Yes, yes yes. This was hands down the best TV show I've watched in years. Utterly faultless. The acting, the effects, the scenery. I didn't take my eyes off the screen every episode.

And if The Child doesn't melt your heart, then you're dead inside ??",10,positive
"The books are fantastic, the first season was good and it seemed they found a good main character, they followed one of the books and did a pretty good adaptation of it. However, the second season was bad. Bad characters, bad adaptation and to boot the actor had to open his mouth on politics and diss more than half of the American polulation so that is the end of him and the show for us. Buh bye reacher and Alan ritchson there will be no season three for us or any more ritchson movies (sorry Henry Cavill who we love).

Definitely would rate 10+ Stars!!!",9,positive
"I watched the season on Amazon and then went back and reread the 1st Reacher book, Killing Floor, on which it was based and which I hadn't read in over a decade. Not 100% consistent with the book or its characters, but I can definitely see why Lee Child was an executive producer on the series and did a cameo in episode 8. This was VERY much more Jack Reacher than the Tom Cruise movies.  In the books, so much of Reacher's demeanor and character stemmed from his size and military background. And unfortunately for Cruise, you simply can't teach 6'5"" (although, in fairness to Tom, Alan Ritchson isn't 6'5"" either, more like 6'2"" and change...but an elevator shoe insert can do a lot more with that; you just can't make Tom Cruise tall enough without CGI). If you've read the books, Reacher is taciturn, and Ritchson can pull off Reacher just standing there; Cruise couldn't.  I can't give the 1st season a 100% rating, but some of that has to do with the original storyline from the book, which is now over two decades old and had to be modernized to place it in a contemporary setting. Some things just didn't translate perfectly. But I binge-watched the 8 episodes and will watch season 2 just as eagerly. Also, some of the rest of the casting threw me slightly, especially for detective Finlay and officer Roscoe, but this wasn't a significant issue; the acting was fine. The second book in the series is Die Trying; hope they decide to keep the order for season 2 and do that one. It's one of the best in the 26-book series.  A big thumbs-up for this resurrection of a great Lee Child character.",8,positive
"Finally...a worthy screen adaptation of the books. Love the books, and this series hasn't disappointed. Tom Cruise shouldn't have ever played this roll (no offence to Tom, as I'm generally a fan of his films). This actor is far more suited to the roll.  Long May it continue.",9,positive

"The Last of Us has FINALLY shattered the dreaded video game curse into a million pieces and then some; Craig Mazin, the man behind Chernobyl, and Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann himself, have made an adaptation for the ages, and made the seemingly impossible a reality. They finally got the video game adaptation form RIGHT! They kept the essence of the story's humanity and desperation, whilst building on top of what worked before and expanding on the areas of the story only briefly touched upon in the game.  And keep in mind, this review is based off TWO EPISODES: and it's already done what many video game movies and tv shows only dreamed of doing: becoming a respectful piece of art that transcends all the barriers of mediums, and showing a good story truly belongs anywhere. You just need the right craftsmen to honour that kind of storied legacy and expand upon the BACKSTORY in an organic way. The Last of Us respects the games perfectly whilst expanding the world we were all introduced to in 2013.  HBO may have finished Game of Thrones, The Sopranos, The Wire, Chernobyl, and maybe even True Detective, but The Last of Us shows there's plenty of creative firepower left in this television powerhouse. And Craig Mazin's fantastic sensibility for disaster in Chernobyl meshed perfectly with Neil Druckmann's cinematically-influenced storytelling and character-driven synergy.  The Last of Us has joined a growing rank of respectful video game adaptations like the Sonic films, Detective Pikachu, Sonic Boom, Castlevania, and hopefully that upcoming Mario movie will deliver the goods too. The Last of Us has set the bar PRETTY damn high, and the source material is why it was such a tall order in the first place. Takes notes, Nintendo and Microsoft. Seems that PlayStation Productions and SEGA are leading the pack right now.  Anyway, this show is fantastic; give or take the games there's STILL the phenomenal story to absorb and the timeless characters bringing life to a Godforsaken post-apocalyptic world. And yet we come back for more anyway.  The Last of Us is a television landmark for sure, and an emotional rollercoaster everyone's bound to try out. 5/5 stars.",9,positive
"Margaret Atwood wrote ""The Handmaid's Tale"" as a cautionary story of what could happen if a fundamentalist Christian regime seized power. I haven't read the novel, but seeing everything that happens in Hulu's adaptation made me realize that this is exactly what the evangelicals keep trying to bring about. Is there any difference between these people and the Taliban?  It was appropriate that the series debuted when it did. A president who brags about molesting women and a vice-president who wants a theocracy made it look all too real. It's one of the most intense shows that you'll ever see, and you definitely should see it. Don't think that it's purely fiction. These sorts of things happened in medieval Europe, 1692 Salem, and other societies that enforce strict gender roles.  Truly deserved its Emmy wins. Excellent show.",10,positive

"It takes an awful lot for me to like anything fantasy based it usually isn't my cup of tea at all. I always get the impression that Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings are at the forefront of the genre and they didn't do it for me. They were good don't get me wrong but just not for me. I'm more of a horror fan than anything especially zombies but something drew me to this so thought I would have a crack.  I was still a little unsure after the first couple of episodes, this is why I rated a 9 and not a 10 as it didn't quite drag me in straight away but after just finishing season one I am officially hooked. Henry as the lead is amazing as are all the other main characters. It is well cast, well acted and a great story so far. Love it.",7,neutral
"Reacher is almost absurd in its premise, with the protagonist being a character of pure fantasy - a deviously constructed archetype, intended to buoy and appeal to a particular racial group. In 2022 you kinda look at this stuff and realise it's an early 90's rip-off at heart, and that there's limited malice intended.  This is not anywhere near the quality of Cruise's first Reacher production, and the lead character lacks the depth of the older version. The plot is almost exactly the same, which is a real shame, since there was no tension involved in the final episodes.  The series was produced on a tight budget, and some of the special effects looked like they were straight VHS.  I thought this was poor overall. Watchable, but a serious downgrade for the franchise. I give it a meh out of ten.",10,positive

"First off, people giving crappy reviews because you: A) Don't understand the storyline OR B) Because of the sex and swearing, need to pay more attention beyond that and/or get out more.  What I think is hilarious, are the people who claim they're a ""Kevin Costner fan"", but are offended by the sex and swearing. I take it they've only seen approximately 1% or less, of his filmography... I will admit that I initially checked this out due to Costner, but soon after, found out the amazing cast and crew attached to this project.  I'm not generally a fan of Westerns, but this had me hooked. In my opinion, this show is beautifully filmed, amazingly acted and has some pretty decent writing. The cast is phenomenal & each hold their own in each episode. Taylor Sheridan has already proved himself as a writer/director with movies such as Wind River (2017), Sicario 1 (2016) + 2 (2018), and Hell or High Water (2015), and Yellowstone (2018) is simply in a similar vein to those amazing films. If you enjoyed those, you will enjoy this. I have just finished Season 1 and I am looking forward to Season 2. I definitely recommend for others to check this out.",10,positive
I have to say that this show has a surprisingly great acting from the support cast. Every character feels unique and you'll definitively remember them. In most TV shows you'll have a main character with good acting but with a horrible freaking side cast that makes things unbearable to watch.  This series tells story that's great but most importantly feels UNIQUE which is why I felt so hooked up on it. It takes place in a early 1900 century post first world war with a story revolving around ex soldiers who tries by any means to climb up the socio-economical hierarchy.,7,neutral
"As a real rancher I was looking forward to a movie about Ranch Life etc. Instead we get a ""Hokey"" spin on ranch life. It is so bad its embarrasing. I like a lot of Costner's work but this is a real bomb for him & the rest of the cast. Who are these supposed writers??? No realistic storyline, & the way they handled the cattle. eye roll, cough cough. Then there is the supposed ""Mustang"" who is really a Quarter Horse. If you wish to refer to a horse as a Mustang then I would suggest casting go get one. So Hokey and disappointing. No more time wasted watching this bummer.",9,positive
"It is always a sign for a good show when lines from it make their way into the vernacular, becoming universally known and used.  In a universe where the Jedi are now a minor force and we are increasingly exploring the other elements of that rich universe The Mandalorian stands head and shoulders above the rest and is possibly the best addition to the franchise since the original movies.  It beautifully balances the familiar with the little known and new so you immediately feel at home while at the same time it feels fresh and new and you are expanding your knowledge of the universe rather than watching rehased stories you already knew or worse having them completely trashed and rewritten (*cough* Star Trek Discovery *cough*)",10,positive
From the start I thought I was watching a Slytherin character at a spin-off Hogwarts school but all in all the show goes well from start to finish with a nice witty character dialogue I found myself giggling at time to time listening to their conversations and Wednesdays need for a negative view on everything.my over all experience was met with satisfaction and I'm left wanting more season 2 please. It Would be nice to have more off the family the Addams gatherings. I was not sure if I would enjoy this but I was wrong in the end the show holds up well the acting is strong on all parts the cinematography is top notch.,6,neutral
"Star Wars was always about one thing: the storytelling. Disney has proven time and time again they can't write a Star Wars story to saved their lives. The entire show is great besides the thing that makes it a show. Seasons 1 & 2 feel like 1 full season which makes it feel so dragged out for no reason. Nothing significant is happening! It's just ""Fetch Quest: The Series.""",10,positive
"I'm a huge fan of The Last of Us Video Game The game had so many emotional moments between Joel & Ellie. It made us feel connected. The audience were on a journey with Joel & Ellie.  Everything about the Video Game is Masterpiece.  But the show....wasn't a masterpiece.  It was average. It tried to copy the game too much, in the end it felt rushed.  I didn't feel connected to Joel or Ellie.  The jokes Ellie made in the show, felt rushed and didn't really hit me like the game does.  The wasn't enough chemistry between Joel & Ellie.  Don't misunderstand, the actors were great but it felt like it was missing something....maybe a soul. It was just bland and average.  I would recommend to people to play the game instead.",7,neutral
"Wednesday is a series I certainly recommend to you, only watch it if you like spooky movies. Firstly, don't you just love big mysteries? Well, I definitely do. This show makes you wonder about who the murderer is. Secondly, Wednesday the character is super dark, but you will love her personality. Her kindness that comes out in all different times , it comes from her mum as a dove. Lastly, monsters jump out of nowhere at times when you don't expect it, which can make you shiver and jump. All together people will love to watch Wednesday. Don't forget to watch series two when it is out!! . Totally recommend.",8,positive

"If you have read the book then this is an absolute must-see. If not, it's definitely a must-see. This adaptation of Margaret Atwood's novel is even more addicting than the book itself. It's more than immersive and it's one of those series you find yourself thinking about even after you've stopped watching. You'll find yourself ruminating over the characters (which were brought to life through stellar acting, by the way) and it's impossible to not want to turn to the next episode. yes, it's really that good.",8,positive

"I saw this show had high ratings. Now I know not to trust IMDB ratings any more.  Being a Star Wars fan, I was looking forward to this show. However, after watching three episodes, each more boring than the previous one, I won't be wasting any more time watching this nonsense.  The story line meanders all over the place. Feels like the writer had no real plot in mind.  The overall motif did stay fairly close to the original Star Wars. However, many of the scenes are shot in semi darkness. That's really annoying.  Imho, Disney has lost the magic. This seems like a poor, sloppy attempt to milk the Star Wars franchise for more money by slapping something together quickly.",8,positive
"One of the greatest shows, and characters, to ever bless our screens in recent memory is coming to an end. I'm conflicted because I'm sad to see it go but I'm also happy I got to watch it. Thomas Shelby was undeniably the standout of the show but Alfie Solomons deserves mention as well. And that's it. That's the end of it. Even if season 6 doesn't live up to expectations I don't think it'll ruin what a good show this has been.",10,positive
"Alan Ritchson is way to gym bunny for Reacher. Teacher is meant to be 'BIG' and hard and gritty - but with a surprisingly but intense intelligence.

The plot is good - as it is in the books - naturally having rad them no surprises - but I get the feeling it's not going to blow you away as told in the series.  Still it was worth a watch.",9,positive
"This dark comedy is one of the best series I have recently seen. Set in a resort hotel in Hawaii, this is superb writing & excellent acting.

"I don't watch much television, as my life is busy and complicated enough. But when friends recommended it my spouse and I did not have high expectations.  This show blew us away, in its excellent writing, casting, musical score, photography and most of all story. After watching Season 1 (and haven't started Season 2 yet) I can say the drug use and sex scenes seemed... a little over-done. Yet the outstanding performances, the believe-ability of the characters, their motives and their limitations, come shining through.  It took the second or third episode before I could see the genius and the story arc's starting to collide into each other. I didn't think there was enough 'there' to pull it off, but it certainly paid off in spades. The final episode of Season 1 I simply did not want to end. It was played picture perfect.  IMHO this is some of the best television I've seen in many years, it's that good.",8,positive
"It gets better and better does'nt it? Episode three was incredible. So much like a full length movie it should be nominated for an Oscar. I guess I am not really a reviewer but an enjoyer of good stuff and this has my attention. The whole concept of fungi not being able to live in the human body because of the temperature is based on fact and the fact is with temps rising on Earth the day may come when we have tp protect ourselves from invasive fungicide. I don't think we will have to worry about zombies, but you never know, do you? Looking for to episode 4 and beyond into the world of the fungi feed. After a billion years of fungi history how does it feel for them to have this new source brain power for hosting and taking over. Are we going to find out how they feel about the human condition, and can we talk them into backing off?",10,positive
"Peaky Blinders may be the best crime family series ever created. It feels as all the dialog was written for each cast member. The story leaves nothing out of the imagination of an audience that has aleady seen it all in the ""Godfather"" , "" Scarface "" movies. But with a new twist that makes it fresh and new. With it's roots as a period piece mingled with amazing contemporary music by the likes of "" Nick cage and the badd seed"" , ""The White Stripes "" and ""Drop kick Murphy"" makes it all the more exciting. It reminds us of the bond of family, whether if it's blood or marriage as a true foundation of purpose. Not to mention the respect of the word and the rights of all to be treated equal, makes this a show worthy of a binge.",9,positive
"That old school Star Wars energy is certainly alive and well in the series ecosystem.  What I found unique here was seeing the story of the Empire's rise through the eyes of the proverbial man in the street and how an oppressive and totalitarian regime can insert itself into society at a slow enough pace that most people will just integrate it into their New Normal. It's refreshing to see and feel the impact of this beyond it just being a story of the Jedi and politicians, but as a story of real and relatable people who don't have resources like Jedi Masters, The Force and fleets of starships at their disposal (yet), and how all that it takes is for someone to go first. I didn't think I'd see a series in the Star Wars universe that makes even The Mandalorian look a bit clunky, but here we are with a gritty, cyberpunk, gimmick-free and honest story that eclipses pretty much all other recent efforts.",9,positive
"Finally, a character like the books. This is the guy I saw in my mind when I was reading the books. And bad guys we can get excited about. The whole series was binged in a weekend - great stuff. Can't wait for season 2!",7,neutral
"Most of these good reviews are from the first season, which makes a lot of sense. It WAS great.  However, the show-running and writing on the second season was some of the worst I've seen. Such as a ten-minute car chase through New York City with automatic fire coming from two ""professional"" hitmen who apparently can't hit the broad side of a barn and failed to attract a single cop; thoughtful dialog replaced with indescriminate and brutal killing that borders on cold-blooded murder; and very poor character development.  Every forum you find on this show is full of fans complaining about the same things. It's apparently already too late to replace the writing team for season three, so let's hope they get the message.",10,positive
"I just saw that this series was filmed in Romania and it's so good to see new things and new opportunities for Romanians. Also the extras and main characters took it to another level, the dedication to shoot this was something new and I don't think anyone can do that even if we are talking about a big production.  This series raised Romania and us as people in this great thing that is happening right now.  All the actors were insanely good in their roles and we all agree that THING did a great job as a hand, the way he expresses his feelings through signs and movement, we are proud of Victor Dorobantu.  Proud to be Romanian <3.",10,positive
"I have enjoyed watching this series. Jenna is good as Wednesday story like is great. Very poor choice for mortisha and gomez.. happy they aren't in it alot or them being in it would really ruin the show. Not thrilled with the tension between Wednesday and her parents, as they not the type of family they were portrayed to be over the past decades. They wee always there for eachother. Not at eachotherz throats. Also feel like pugsly would have been a good addition to the school with Wednesday as its weird to seem them apart. I understand that she is suppose to be troubled and that is why she is at nevermore. The series could have been better. The 6 star rating is for Jenna and the other ""teens"" with her.",1,negative
"Crikey this is a great series and really has it all. Solid acting all the way around and definitely worth watching.

"What a refreshing series.  Character building X Plot X Realistic Acting X Good Dialogue X  It was really nice having such an adult tone with great dialogue and acting that's been sorely lacking from every SW series (including Mando which I liked).  Yes zoomers this is what a plot and character building looks like. This is how you build a memorable story and avoid a Mary Sue (Rey) that no one will care about the minute they leave the theater. I'm sorry they didn't throw any lightsabers or baby yoda in as gimmicks to keep your attention and cover up a garbage plot (Boba Fett).  I'm also glad they didn't crap all over past characters (episodes 7,8,9) or go to the usual man hating girl power ridiculousness we've come to expect from Disney.  Let's just hope they don't mess it up going forward.",7,neutral

"This is not your Star Wars for kids. This is only for adults. It's emotional, dark and sometimes messed up. Forget all the other Star Wars shows this one is the best. Rogue One was and still is my favorite Star Wars movie. And I was skeptical about a Andor show. But I am hooked and am sad that only 3 more episodes are left til it's all over. This is definitely one of the shows I will rewatch. The score is amazing and really helps you feel for the characters and feel their pain and loss. This show also shows how the messed up the Empire really is. Just watch the show you will not regret it!!!!!",9,positive

Selling romantic idea of farming in usa no steroids here. Most of the native american actors suck. But i think u Americans have these natives who would deserve an own drama series one day. Mountains and fields of course amazing. Loads of killing and shooting for men viewers. Point is to sell"" texas"" theme Americans and educate about them and i think they succeed.",9,positive
"This show restored my love for Star Wars, which for a long time was on the low. This isn't Jedi, Sith, Force. It's not even a space western-esque Mandalorian. This is down to earth and wider scale at the same time. A world-building experience, which very neatly ties into its own sequel movie and subsequently to the ever nostalgic original trilogy. Sets, actors, story are all great. There is no need to trust in the Force with this one. Just watch it. Two seasons of not only the best Star Wars show, but one of the best overall series recently. It may not be reapeated in SW universe, but I surely hope it will become a thing to strive for and surpass for other shows following it.",10,positive
"I love it love it love it. Characters are great BUT... the exception is Triss. It has ruined the whole thing for me.

"Went in to Wednesday not expecting much and it turned out to be very good. I think the biggest reason is two of the stars - Jenna Ortega as the deadpan Wednesday and the outstanding Gwendoline Christie as fashionable yet acidly sweet Principal Weems. These two along with an ok cast, great sets and fantastic costume make this rather thin murder/mystery keep you engaged. Also, the whole concept of Nevermore Academy is just a rip off of Hogwarts, in this case for 'outcast' that covers vampires, wolves, sirens and gorgons. That part of the story, and the supernatural elements, is deficient to say the least. Yet, this is much more a tween oriented series so on that basis Wednesday is much better than a lot of other series out there.",2,negative
"I'm doing okay (but not really) with the story line and the characters, although it is/they are as quirky as hell. The only character that rings true is Nicole Mossbacher.  This is supposed to be a comedy and I'm still waiting for the funny. The two episodes I have watched are good for entertainment value only while I work on my laptop.  My main objection is the LOUD, INTRUSIVE, POUNDING background music that is giving me migraines! Have Mercy!",1,negative
"I think Peaky Blinders is one of the best dramas ever made which has been Great British image to display This series has great music and camera angles and It has evolved in the history of tv.

"I thought this was okay. Not terrible, but certainly worth all the rave reviews. It feels like people have just jumped on a bandwagon.  Literally NOTHING of note happens for four episodes. You couldn't get away with things like that in the old days of people watching week by week. Everyone would have switched off.  Jennifer Coolidge is good as Tanya but the character gets more and more annoying as the episodes play out.  I stuck with series two just because I thought there must be a huge denouement. There wasn't.  The guy from Essex was also really poorly written.  I really don't get all of the hype.",3,negative
"This is an anthology style series where every season has a new story line with new characters. Season 1 was great, i enjoyed all of the characters and how they all intertwined. There was some mystery in seeing where the story would go, which kept me looking forward to the next episode. I came up here to change my review on season 2 because I sorta talked bad about it, the first half of the season was kinda slow so I gave up on it but I did eventually go back to finish and it picked up on the later episodes. Last episode was a roller coaster. I can definitely say that I am looking forward to season 3.",6,neutral
"When i first saw this poster for the show i was super excited since i used to love Adams Family! And guess what... This did not disappoint!  First of all, the actors were fantastic but especially Jenna Ortega. The cast worked great together and i could feel the chemistry though my screen.  This show was not what i was expecting out of an Adams Family reboot but i think Tim Burton did an amazing job with giving Wednesday a new storyline and background. This show came with a lot of fun but insane twists that will leave your jaw on the floor every episode. And to be completely honest i wasn't expecting that last one which just shows how unpredictable this show can be! Definitly one of my favorites this year.",9,positive
"Yellowstone, a television series that aspires to be an epic western drama, falls short of its lofty ambitions. From its contrived plot twists to its uninspired character development, the show struggles to rise above mediocrity, ultimately leaving viewers with a sense of disappointment.  One of the most glaring issues with Yellowstone is its reliance on predictable and melodramatic storytelling. The series seems to prioritize shock value over substance, throwing in one implausible twist after another in a desperate attempt to keep audiences engaged. Instead of investing in well-crafted narratives, Yellowstone often feels like a haphazard collection of sensational events strung together without a coherent vision.  The characters, despite being surrounded by a breathtaking backdrop of the Montana wilderness, lack depth and fail to evoke genuine empathy. John Dutton, portrayed by Kevin Costner, is meant to be the patriarchal figure anchoring the series, yet his character is marred by inconsistent writing and questionable decision-making. The attempts to humanize him through strained family dynamics come across as forced, contributing to an overall lack of authenticity in the character portrayals.  The series also suffers from a lack of nuance in its depiction of complex issues such as land disputes and environmental concerns. Instead of exploring the intricacies of these topics, Yellowstone resorts to simplistic and often clichéd representations. The conflict between the Dutton family and various adversaries feels more like a caricature of a western feud than a thoughtful exploration of the challenges faced by ranchers in the modern world.  Furthermore, the dialogue in Yellowstone often veers into the realm of melodrama, with characters delivering lines that sound more like overwrought monologues than authentic conversations. The heavy-handed approach to dialogue diminishes the impact of crucial scenes, making it difficult for viewers to take the characters and their predicaments seriously.  The series also grapples with pacing issues, oscillating between frenetic action sequences and sluggish moments of exposition. This uneven rhythm disrupts the narrative flow, leaving viewers disoriented and disconnected from the unfolding events. The pacing concerns contribute to an overall sense of frustration, as the audience is left yearning for a more cohesive and engaging viewing experience.  Yellowstone's portrayal of female characters is another area where the series falters. Despite the potential for strong, multidimensional women in a western setting, the female characters often feel like mere accessories to the male-driven plotlines. Their arcs are underdeveloped, and they frequently serve as devices to further the storylines of their male counterparts rather than standing on their own merit.  The cinematography, while capturing the grandeur of the Montana landscape, cannot compensate for the fundamental flaws in storytelling and character development. Beautiful panoramic shots of the wilderness become a veneer attempting to mask the lack of substance beneath. The scenic backdrop, rather than enhancing the narrative, feels like an aesthetic distraction used to compensate for the show's narrative shortcomings.  In conclusion, Yellowstone fails to live up to the expectations set by its premise and cast. The series struggles with contrived storytelling, one-dimensional characters, and a lack of nuance in addressing pertinent issues. While the picturesque setting of the Montana wilderness offers a visually appealing backdrop, it cannot salvage a narrative that lacks depth and authenticity. For viewers seeking a truly compelling and well-crafted western drama, Yellowstone is a disappointment that falls far short of the mark.",9,positive
"I love dystopia. I really do, and I'm enjoying this series. I can't help but feel though there is this giant plot hole right in the middle, and it starts with the Republic of Gilead. These people are really weird. They're like a cult, yet the show never really explains how a crazy cult took over. Yes, this world has fertility and contamination problems, but hard times do not necessarily create huge cults.  . In fact, most cults happen through brainwashing, but that's not what the flashbacks show. For instance, Nick decided to join the weird ones because he was having trouble finding a job. Really? The cult bigwigs decided to have the strange sex ceremony with their handmaids because they were afraid that it would upset their wives if they didn't include them? Are you serious? Unless you're a psychopath, it takes a lot to go in and kill unarmed people, hanging their bodies in a church. In the beginning, it shows Aunt Lydia brainwashing the handmaids, but in reality, she's doing a crappy job because I have yet to see a handmaid that truly embraces her lot in life, except maybe crazy Janine.  Not to mention, you'd think that cult members would be a lot more fanatical then what is portrayed. I always think of cult members as having a devout religious fervor or an absolute total belief in their doctrine and leaders. After all, during the witch trials, huge swathes of people truly believed in witches. However, in the show, most of the characters don't appear to truly believe what they are saying. Maybe it's the actors, but because of this, the bad guys just seem like weird autocratic despots who murder, torture and subjugate their people like all dictators. Where's the outrage that started this cult mentality? The show mostly focuses on the suffering of the handmaids and doesn't really explain the shift in point of view. In fact, the show just takes it for granted that religious fundamentalists will automatically go out and slaughter people if contamination and fertility problems occur, and that all kinds of people will hop on board to support them. Seriously?  I also keep thinking there should be a cult bigwig, like Jim Jones, Reverend Moon, or Big Brother. Don't cults need a savior? And who are all these men with guns who go around shooting and hanging people? Gilead is very well armed, but how did they get that way? I guess all these men are all supposed to be as stupid as Nick.  In '1984,' Orwell showed how people could become brainwashed fanatics, and accept that 2+2=5. So far 'The Handmaid's Tale' has not shown this. Consequently, it doesn't really make sense and it fails to be a truly prophetic and thought provoking dystopia. I'm still enjoying it though. I'm one of those that usually gives a lot of leeway to television and movies as long as they're entertaining.",2,negative
"Why are the critics so down on this show? Every professional critic I have read online have nothing really good to say about each episode or the entire series? Then you read the fan reviews and the majority of fans love the show, rate it 8-10 out of 10!  I think the fans know what they like, and they ""LOVE"" this show Yellowstone!! As a big fan myself. I think the cast is perfect, the story is wonderful and perfectly timed, the location, beyond beautiful. Each episode brings out a little more of each member of the Dutton family and still leaves you wanting more. To the point after each episode I am sometimes stressed waiting to find out what happens next week.  Now the season is over. My review, 10 out of 10 and holding my breath waiting for season two. Yes I am fan and as a ""fan"" I want to remind the cast, writer, producers, that the ""fans"" are the only ones you need to listen to!

As a fan of the Addams Family films and especially the original TV program from the 60s I was very impressed with this series. I hope there is a second season. OH and anything Tim Burton is my Jam. Jenna Ortega is fab. Actually all the cast is Fabulous It was nice seeing Fred Armisen who makes a cameo as Uncle Fester. Not like Christopher Lloyd Uncle Fester but like Jackie Coogan style with his own take on the character ( the original Actor who played Uncle Fester) I would have given 10/10 but without spoiling any thing. Something happens to a character which I thought was unexpected and unnecessary in my opinion. When you see it you will know what I'm talking about .I think it's a great show for any age I'm in my forties and binged the whole 8 episodes. There is some cussing so anyone under 14 you might want to cover their ears lol but I don't know what most people feel is appropriate for their child mine are in there 20s so I'm sure they have heard and said far worse. Any who. Keep an open mind. Try not to compare this with other Addams Family movies or character portrayal. Like u said before I binged the whole thing in one rainy afternoon. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Hope this was helpful I'm sure 47 out of 50 will .,6,neutral
"The show is ok. It's build right, the plot is like every deactivate show with kids... I don't really get a lot of things in the shows.  The best example is the building of the Cearchters in the show. The process is too fast and there is not deepness.  I think the show was in one derction and suddenly it's changed very fast to another story line that we didn't really intereste to see.  The writers try to explain the story in the best way they could but in the way they forgot lot of important thing.  I have to say I was impressed by the beginning of the show. But suddenly it's all changed.  I think this is the next Riverdale. And if the shoe wants to seccsed the writers got think wildly and more creative about the next seasons.",6,neutral
"After suffering over 6 hours of watching 6 endless episodes, just like Carrie Bradshaw, I couldn't help but wonder: did I watch something else than the other viewers?  The music: creepy, later just unnecessary.  The characters: white and privileged brainless people without any remarkable features. No one likeable.  The story (what story exactly?) happens and was shot in Hawaii but from what I saw it could have been shot at any random fancy resort.  It's marketed as a black comedy/drama. I have to ask: where is the humour? No laughter from me, not even a smile. 30 years ago, this slow pacing would have meant cancelling of the series after only one episode. But nowadays shows like this are popular, for whatever reason. Think Bly Manor.  I love Jennifer Coolidge but here she acts letargic and sleepy. Her comedic talent is not used at all. In general, the characters are flat, almost not human, like some bored slave holders.  Where is the satire? I am not a genius but if something is boring than I don't like it, simple as that. 2 stars.",3,negative

Some Star Wars fanboys will tell you that the worst thing about it is that it ""doesn't feel like Star Wars anymore"". My father, who has been a devotee since the genesis of the saga in the 1970s (i.e a bit longer than the YouTube nerds who make that complaint), supplied an interesting rebuttal:  ""Being that Andor doesn't feel like anything we've seen in this series for the past few decades, it actually DOES feel like Star Wars -- specifically, the 1977 film Star Wars (before it was named Episode IV or A New Hope or whatever); a film that at one point in time felt new; a film that whisked you away to worlds you hadn't seen before. Andor 'feels' like Star Wars in the purest possible way. It feels more like Star Wars than Star Wars has felt since it was first conceived.""  But the original 1977 movie isn't the only old-school George Lucas picture that Andor brings to mind. Some of the new locations we see (and yes, the emphasis is on ""new"") are reminiscent of THX-1138 -- particularly an eerie labor prison that looks more interesting than any of the planets and starships in the Sequel Trilogy combined. Other parts of the galaxy, shown to us at the height of the Empire's oppression, seem like something out of Metropolis or Brazil (which itself owes a lot to George Orwell and, sure enough, THX) and the music often plays like something out of Blade Runner 2049.  The influences are clear, yet my point still stands. Andor gives a sense of size to this faraway galaxy that hasn't been felt in ages. We aren't simply seeing the same old characters and places again.  It should be noted that all of this entails high-effort movie-making (another way in which this doesn't feel the way Star Wars has felt LATELY, especially not the Disney+ era). It's so weird. It's almost like I'm watching an actual TV series made by humans; not the latest bit of content slop from the Disney+ factory. The sceneries, sets, photography, effects, performances, and characterizations actually suggest a fully-realized creative project; not a barely releasable piece of nostalgia bait born of two unrelated first drafts spliced together.  Basically: Watching this right after finishing Obi-Wan Kenobi (or even after other recent streaming titles like The Rings of Power and whatever Marvel made this week) is like watching an X-2000 train run over a wobbly tricycle. This isn't just a vessel for selling toys. It is a sincere creation that largely eluded corporate meddling and also dared play these images straight (we've reached a point of Marvel-brand comedy and meta cheekiness where creating something that's actually serious feels like the subversive thing to do).  It isn't just 6-10 episodes thrown together to keep the stream machine running and rev up Soyjak excitement with some fresh Member Berries. It isn't about Boba Fett beating up mooks or Grogu being all adowable. It's about a group of protesters defiantly playing their instruments at a phalanx of Imperial troopers.  Of course there are eventually Member Berries, but the show is patiently paced and builds towards them, as opposed to blowing its load straight away (as with Darth Vader in the aforementioned Kenobi). Moreover, they're call-backs that make sense, given that it is a prequel to Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and so brings back the likes of, not just Diego Luna as outlaw Cassian Andor, but also Forest Whitaker as proto-Rebellion leader Saw Gerrera and Genevieve O'Reilly as the younger-ish Mon Mothma (in addition to seminal franchise newbies like Stellan Skarsgård, Kyle Soller, Faye Marsay, and Andy Serkis -- who isn't technically new to Star Wars, having also voiced/mo-capped Snoke, but gives a show-stealing performance in a rare live-action outing). Nothing here is at the level of Dave Filoni bringing in Cad Bane for no reason, nor the Luke Skywalker cameo in The Mandalorian that Book of Boba Fett has now made all the more narratively pointless.  And of course, it's simply a smart business choice to remind consumers of Rogue One. Back when The Mandalorian and BOBF started lifting things from the Prequel Trilogy, many nerds quipped ""Man, the Sequel Trilogy really effed everything up so badly that we're turning to the prequels for nostalgia favor"". Then, Kenobi came out and seemed to make fans a bit sour on the idea of returning to the prequel era -- a barely de-aged Hayden Christensen only gets you so far. So that leaves Rogue One as the one recent Star Wars film that's fairly well-liked.  Rogue One always appeared more mature than its peers, without losing the essential sense of adventure, so it makes sense that it would lead to one of the more mature shows in the franchise (though the show is appreciably better than the film, almost as if the best way to win back favor isn't to reference the right movie or EU novel, but to make a show that's actually good). It's more direct in its critique of fascism, militarized police, et al., yet avoids falling back on preachy mouthpiece characters -- for the most part -- and also challenges our modern id-political instincts to praise Denise Gouch's character as a strong girlboss climbing the ranks, as we're made to realize she's still decidedly a fascist officer.  Does that make it a bit boring at points? I suppose, but I'm sure there's a series of Disney+ shorts starring Jabba the Hutt in the works if that's the side of Star Wars you're looking for. There's also a Star Wars: The Clone Wars spin-off on the platform right now; it's got all kinds of lightsabers, blasters, and obvious baddies fighting obvious goodies.  Leave the ""new"" to those of us who don't ""get"" Star Wars. Remember how people complained that the first short in Star Wars: Visions was ""too much like Kurosawa"" when Kurosawa is one of the direct influences of the franchise? Chances are they think Andor is ""too much like '70s-era George Lucas"" and so they'll let us enjoy it in peace.",8,positive

"I tried many times to ride on the Star Wars band wagon but it always failed to attract my appreciation. I didnt get the craze it wasnt my nostalgia I had none. Whatever star wars I have watched felt mediocre at best. May be I liked Mandalorian a little mostly because of baby yoda but nothing else. Here comes Andor and I had literally no hope for a lesser known character to give me any surprises and boy I am happy to say I got my Star Wars.  This series scores A+ on all departments of film making never trusted Disney to deliver on that. World building, characters, acting, cgi, Direction, background score, story telling, building tension you name it and it just delivers episode after episode. The Finale was tense all through, loved the pacing, may be the end could have been a little more satisfying still loved it. First time you can feel the real Empire and its evilness. Characters were not fancy but believable even the evil ones. Waiting for season 2 to expand the Empire universe a bit more. Its a 9/10 for season 1.",10,positive
"I was holding out hope that one of my favourite book series would really be given the tv series it deserves. Season 1 was totally pulled oblong by Cavil, but season 2 is definitely getting better. Between the books, PS games and the tv series, it's best not to compare the story lines as you can get super confused??",9,positive
"I loved every second of the series, it reminds me a little of the Harry Potter movies, in a good way. The plot is fascinating and attracts the screen to such a degree that it is difficult to stop watching for a second, Also I don't think there is anyone who could have played Wednesday better than Jenna and The only thing that disappointed me is that the series is relatively short, and I finished it quickly, and for something that draws so much to the screen I would have expected more, But I'm definitely looking forward to a sequel series and seeing where it goes next, and what else Tim has planned for Wednesday.",6,neutral

"This show to me is the idea of sticking the TV on for a spot of escapism. Instantly transported many miles away into the North American Yellowstone, Montana. The local ranch life, power struggle, chess playing politics and a lot of bodies quickly follow that!  We have here a great selection of characters to appreciate, relate and dissimilate from. John and Beth Dutton, plus Rip one of the wranglers on the Ranch are all fantastically written and portrayed.  Also does Kevin Costner age? He looks the same as the first movie I saw him in.  Some of the story writing I do struggle with though - how many people can you kill on these ranches and still fly under the radar!? Also is Jamie Dutton really some kind of malice character. They seem to write him to be in and out but I struggle to pick it up sincerely when his in the scenes.",10,positive
"There's something here that is profoundly special that everyone needs to experience. I'm just locked in the entire time, eyes glue to the screen.

It's all perfection and no show I've watched has achieved everything here I've listed so perfectly. I cannot wait to see how this plays out! All my friends are watching my parents want to watch it, it's a show that everyone will be talking about because of how amazingly well produced and directed it is. All I can say is wow! Good job team. I want more!",10,positive
"Wednesday TV series from Netflix is quite good. They even managed to keep the intrigue till the middle of last episode, which is quite rare nowadays. My only wish would be to have a better world-building, because it is almost non-existent here outside of the plot-related stuff. Maybe people more familiar with Addams' lore can better navigate it, but I have quite a few open questions about the world.  Regardless, Ortega was good in the role, and I certainly would not mind another season. Luckily, the ending does suggest a possibility for one. Would not surprise me if it will get 3rd season, too.",8,positive
Well done story showing all competing interests to the way it life of the character Kevin Costner portrays,9,positive
"First season was really good - tn lots of drama, well acted, of course great scenery. Shortly there after, though, John Dutton, and most of the characters he's gathered around him, show their selfishness and even depravity. Yes, drama and sets are still good, but it's turned into ""the Sopranos take Montana"". I suppose if you like that show you'll like this, but I don't.  There are lots of people who choose their family or group, and excuse all their excesses. I just think it's being slightly glorified here and I'd rather watch something a little bit more uplifting. Hopefully, Kevin Coster sets the site on such this winter and makes a clean break!",10,positive
"I enjoyed every second of this seires and await season 3 with open arms. As some reviewers have said this is how you capture the feeling of starwars while creating of a new fresh story. Literally brought a smile to face all the way through and the season 2 finale ....... no words to explain. This seires and possibly 'Rouge One' are carrying the Starwars franchise on their shoulders.  This is how its done Disney, now you just need to sort the main story films out and you are flying. 9/10, its worth paying for Disney plus just for this. Binge watch it in a couple of days then cancel it until 2022 for the next season haha.",2,negative
Stellar production and writing. The team assembled for this is BRILLIANT. Replicate this and keep moving forward Disney. TAKE CHANCES AND RISKS like this and Star Wars may see a bright future. Not so sure about a young Luke Skywalker spinoff. We had all of that in the original trilogy.  BRING MARK HAMMIL BACK IN A LUKE AS A MASTER JEDI SERIES. You ruined the new trilogy killing Luke off. Just SHAMEFULLY done. A disgrace to the name brand. We hope you bankrupt yourselves financially and WAKE UP.,10,positive
I don't usually go for series that are overrated because most of the time they're not that entertaining before I could even finish one episode. This one is different though and for its genre it piques my interest and I found myself looking forward to what's going to happen next. The story is well written and characters were portrayed perfectly. It can be quite gory but at the same time I'm for how the events are well organized; it just doesn't give you the feeling that they wrote it in a rush. Every episode gives you mixed emotions -one episode makes you happy and then the next thing you know you're frustrated. Kudos to its writers I'm looking forward to watch more like Peaky Blinders in the future.,10,positive
"This is such a binge worthy show that I'm holding back the last couple episodes like slowing down before the last few chapters of my favorite book. I'm not ready for it to be over just yet. As someone else mentioned, this show is all about character. You can't help but root for the Shelby's, regardless of how horrible they are. There's a line in the first season, ""You are bad men, but you are our bad men."" Pretty much sums it up.  Cillian Murphy is the backbone of this show. He says more in his face and through his eyes than any of the dialogue that comes out of his mouth. Although, don't be mistaken, the writing is excellent. However, being the ignorant American I am, I finally had to turn the subtitles on! My ears got used to the strong accents for the most part but I found myself rewinding at least once an episode to either catch a phrase I wasn't familiar with or because the dialogue was too quiet. So I just said to hell with it and turned the subtitles on - now I'm catching way more. I also wasn't familiar with too much British history between World War 1&2 - so I've found myself looking different bits up to find out more. We've had American gangsters in film for years, but this is a fresh and new experience.  I mentioned Cillian Murphy but the other stars of this show are incredible in their own right. Helen McCrory's Aunt Polly could hold her own against Gemma Teller any day. Paul Anderson and Joe Cole are perfect as the brothers. Anderson tortured and erratic, Cole steady and loyal. Annabelle Wallis and Sam Neill are both compelling and Tom Hardy is Tom Hardy, if he's ever bad I haven't seen it.  If you like a show that's character driven but with an exciting, dark backdrop - definitely worth checking out. TV has really gotten better the last few years.",8,positive
"Ive read all 9 books, played all 3 games and I hoped the series would be good. I have to say i love Henry Cavill in his Role. Only Triss I would change her, cause of the hair. I can understand that its not really easy to follow the story when you dont know the books. But you will understand when you watch all episodes. Some changes to the books im skeptic. But i hope they will end up finally good.  Thanks for reading it. My english is not the best ;)",8,positive
"For years video game adaptations have always been considered to be the worst of the worst but in recent years they have ever so slowly started to get better and better so when I heard Last of Us was getting a show then I just assumed it wouldn't be great. Then, I played the game and absolutely loved it so much that it's now my favorite video game of all time and that got me more excited and I'm glad to say the show surpassed any and all expectations I had for it. It stays true to the game while also being just different enough to make it stand out from the game as well. Pretty much every episode is great or perfect in my opinion. They do an amazing job at fleshing out more of the outside world beyond the main characters which the game doesn't do. It makes the situation seem more real and terrifying. The production design is absolutely incredible. Each set feels very lived in and abandoned. The creators definitely used that massive budget for the show and it really does show. The writing and directing for every episode is top notch and all the performances are incredible too. This is definitely my favorite performance from Pedro Pascal and while I definitely prefer Troy Baker's Joel from the game, Pascal does an incredible job still. Bella Ramsey was perfect as Ellie and was pretty much copy and paste over from the game in performance. The guest actors all did an amazing job as well with Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett from Episode 3 being some of the best performances ever in a TV show. In fact, Episode 3 is not only the best episode of the show, it's genuinely one of my favorite episodes of a TV show ever. My only real major complaint with the show is that the Riley episode wasn't fully necessary. It's a great episode and the ending is amazing but I feel that episode should have just been intertwined throughout the show instead of getting its own dedicated episode as it does grind the show to a halt. This is easily the best video game adaptation out there and is likely to not be beaten for a very long time. I'd highly recommend this show to anyone who loves the game or just wants some good television.",10,positive
"Easily one of the worst in total memory. Very, very weak script that is mostly stupid. Very, very slow pace if one is discernable at all. Totally uninteresting characters. No message. No point.

"The script was just abysmal, making mediocre performances even more mediocre. Wednesdays character had promise but poor execution.  I know it's hard to act bad characters and the writing left so much to be desired, but the performances felt like they'd be more comfortable on Nickelodeon than a series designed to be dark and uncomfortable.  It was unclear where Wednesdays line of creepiness was, and the idea of the men following her round with their tongues lolling out was reminiscent of a fanfiction written circa 2007, uninspired and unbelievable.  Premise of never more also confusing regarding whether it was meant to be a known or unknown secret. Had to stop watching I couldn't bear the cringe.",2,negative
"My fiance and I loved the series, he's a huge fan of the games. We really enjoyed the first series, the acting is on point. The only thing that bothers a bit is Ciri's eye colour, but other than that, we really like it. Can't wait for series 2!",6,neutral
"I finally got round to watching this show about 10 years after it came out, and my god did it live up to the hype.  There is some characters that stick with you that are just legendary throughout time, and Thomas Shelby is one of them.  Absolutely fantastic storylines, every character and actor was phenomenal, it was raw, emotional, funny at times..  Another actor i've discovered through this show who i also won't forget is Paul Anderson who played Arthur Shelby. Watching him and Cillian Murphy together felt special and like nothing you would see again. It felt genuine, like this wasn't acting.  One of the best shows i've ever seen. Don't miss it.",10,positive
An amazing start to probably an amazing show. The series so far doesn't stick on the same path as the game. The beginning and middle are basically it's own standalone show. The only problem I have with it is the third act in the 1st episode. The last 30 minutes goes by too fast and doesn't even include the part where Joel and Tess scavenge the apartment for supplies. Other than that it is a phenomanal start. It is equally as funny and gory as the game and the actors do amazing. I thought this show wouldn't live up to my expectations but it definitely exceeded them. The hour and a half runtime goes super fast and only feels like 20 minutes.,10,positive

"Netflix's the witcher is simply outstanding. Don't mind the bad reviews. I didn't play the game nor did i read the novel, but speaking as a person who has a good grasp and understanding of the show, i will tell you that this show is one of a kind. At first it will be confusing, seeing as they were trying to link up different timelines. But in the end you will come to see it is a very beautiful plot. And kudos to henry, his performance was so crazy. The effects are nice, the fight scenes are beautiful. Generally speaking, it's a great show.",4,negative
"I've enjoyed this series very much so far. The characters are played very well by the actors and for once they wrote the child character as not overly bratty and annoying.  My main gripe is this tendency in modern series to grind the action to a halt with stand alone flashback episodes. I know not every episode can move the story along and knowing a characters past can explain their actions now. However these episodes are usually overlong and they lack subtlety.  This is the case with episode 3 and 7 of this series. We get 1 hour long episodes that could easily have been condensed in 15 minutes. The audience is not dumb, writers need to stop thinking they are.  It was especially problematic in episode 7 because episode 6 was so good and then we were left hanging. These breaks in the story actually kill momentum and do not serve as cliffhangers like the writers think they do. A measure of proof is episodes 3 and 7 are the lowest rated here. They are fine episodes but momentum and story killers not enhancers.  That being said this is an outstanding series and the friendship between the two leads is very endearing and well played.",10,positive
"Even Jenna Ortega (who Carrie's the show), Christina Ricci and Gwendoline Christie who exceed in their roles can't save this show.  Where is Tim Burton?? Not in this show that's for sure!! Since when did Wednesday develop feelings?? She's iconic in her darkness and sarcasm which are lacking here.  This is only a pathetic blend of Sabrina the teenage witch, Harry Potter and X-men that they decided to add ""the Addams Family"" in the mix and even the Addams Family is not present at all.  Some will argue it's about the daughter. But I don't know who this Wednesday is because it's definitely not Wednesday ADAMS. Loved Christina Ricci's Wednesday and I'm sticking with that version and the original in black and white. This would have been pleasant if it had been called differently with other names for the characters as it is exactly that...same names for the old characters we love but with a much changed scenario, plot and overall lack of dark humor.  I'd say it deserves a 4.5 but since there's no half stars I'll give it a 4.",8,positive
The first two seasons of White Lotus were absolutely brilliant. Every episode brought a wittiness that was sometimes shocking and refreshing at the same time considering the BS that is pumped out on the multitude of channels that exist these days. So of course I was very pleased that there would be in fact a season 3. Well... I have just finished episode 4 and not only has the plane not left the airport... but I really don't know where the destination is... and the writers of this season have not written well enough for me to even care. As with the previous seasons... the Cinematography is of the highest order... very artsy and a joy to see... but the story line and the characters suck in season 3.,4,negative
"But it still seems like a show half for adults and half for kids. Why does this werewolf look so cartoony. Its so stupid looking. Also...why in a school full of werewolves, is this the only one called a monster? It sure as heck looks like a werewolf. Why did the writers not understand that in order for us to believe it is a monster, that we would need to compare it against another werewolf? Unless its part of the ""Twist"" which will probably it was all devised by her mother to get her to like school.  I keep seeing tim burtons name...and i also keep seeing the werewolf...put those two together and you have a goosebumps episode. I do not lhink these episodes should be a hour long each. There is just too much filler per episode.",8,positive
"The series is simply mesmerizing with its atmosphere and Istria. The ideal line between the harsh, cruel Middle Ages and the magical world that looks in some scenes is even more severe.

"Definitely not into 'teenage'-shows and not having watched anything from the Addams family line, I was first not planning to watch this show. After being recommended a lot of Jenna Ortega's interviews in social media and a recommendation from a close person, I started watching this show. I had to get used to the fantasy feeling of Harry Potter and the modern feeling of a teen series, but certainly was worth is. Was pleasantly surprised, by the all-around experience. Not necessarily the best plot, but the actors all did a good job filling there character. This show was all-in-all entertaining.

"When HBO first started making TV shows they could never have fully known the path they would forge to make television shows stand shoulder to shoulder, and indeed in some cases, head and shoulders above their big screen brethren. Yellowstone is one of the finest examples of this. I'm a big fan of Taylor Sheridan and this show only strengthens my appreciation and awe for his writing. Sicario was an instant favourite of mine while Wind River is fantastic too. As ever, the dialogue he writes here is phenomenal; proper heavyweight fayre, but not so heavy to the point that you're left with your head spinning after watching one episode too many. The cast clearly relishes chewing through scenes with the stuff he writes, and who could blame them?? The cast are heavyweight too; I've always been a huge Costner fan and to say that this show continues his renaissance as an actor would be very unfair to Yellowstone, because there's a very valid argument that this is the best work he's ever done, perhaps only tying with Dances, and Wyatt Earp, the latter being one of my all-time favorite movies. Luke Grimes, Cole Hauser, Kelly Reilly and Wes Bentley all support him perfectly making this one of the best casts in television right now. Sheridan directs too and needless to say simply a writer, he ain't. He makes full use of the gorgeous, sweeping locations at his disposal to really help immerse us in the world of the big ranch. This show is not for everyone though, it has some dark themes and regularly lays bare the fragility of life, the despair of living and the evil men can do to other men. That being said, it's hugely rewarding, and more touching family moments serve to cast a beam of light on some of the darker places this show takes us. First-rate television.",8,positive
"The Handmaid's Tale on Hulu is a chilling and thought-provoking series that earns a solid 7 out of 10 from me. This show, set in the dystopian society of Gilead, pulls no punches in its depiction of a world where women are stripped of their rights and reduced to mere vessels for reproduction. Elisabeth Moss shines as June Osborne (Offred), delivering a performance so raw and intense that you can't help but be drawn into her struggle. Her portrayal of June's defiance, despair, and resilience anchors the series, making her a character you root for despite the overwhelming odds against her.  The series excels in its social commentary, drawing unsettling parallels to contemporary issues in the United States. The theocratic regime of Gilead, with its public executions, mandatory religious observances, and draconian laws governing women's bodies, echoes current debates about reproductive rights, gender equality, and the separation of church and state. The forced surrogacy and loss of autonomy experienced by the Handmaids are stark reminders of real-world concerns over legislation that limits women's control over their bodies.  Visually, ""The Handmaid's Tale"" is stunning. The muted color palette emphasizes the bleakness of Gilead, while the red attire of the Handmaids against the gray and blue tones symbolizes both their oppression and their significance in this twisted society. The cinematography often employs tight framing and shallow focus, creating a sense of claustrophobia and control that immerses you in the characters' suffocating experiences.  However, the show is not without its flaws. While the central narrative is strong, some subplots and character arcs feel underdeveloped or inconsistent. Characters like Nick Blaine, portrayed by Max Minghella, and Commander Joseph Lawrence, played by Bradley Whitford, sometimes lack the depth and clarity needed to fully understand their motivations and roles within Gilead's power structure. These gaps can leave viewers confused about certain characters' loyalties and actions.  Additionally, the pacing of the series can be uneven. Certain episodes drag with prolonged scenes of suffering and oppression that, while powerful, can feel repetitive and emotionally exhausting. This sometimes hampers the show's ability to maintain momentum, leading to a few slow patches where the narrative seems to stall.  The show's reflection of modern issues is both its strength and its crux. While it effectively highlights the dangers of extreme ideologies, it occasionally veers into didacticism, where the parallels to real-world politics are so overt that they risk overshadowing the story. For example, the show's commentary on environmental degradation and its impact on fertility, though relevant, sometimes feels like a secondary theme that doesn't always integrate smoothly with the main narrative.  ""The Handmaid's Tale"" is a poignant and visually arresting series that offers a stark warning about the dangers of authoritarianism and the erosion of rights. Its powerful performances and relevant themes make it a must-watch, despite some pacing issues and underdeveloped subplots. The show's ability to mirror contemporary societal fears and its emphasis on the importance of resistance and hope amidst oppression earn it a solid 7 out of 10.",10,positive
"This show has very little to do with the original Addams family show or the movies from the 90s. I don't know whose Wednesday this is, but I don't recognize her mannerisms, actions, nor aesthetic.  The beauty of the Addams Family was that it was an eccentric family living in the normal world. So choosing to place her in a school for outcasts defeats the whole point. What was anyone thinking while making this?  Love Jenna Ortega as an actress, but her face is too conventionally beautiful to be Wednesday. They should have casted someone with a quirkier look and essence. She relied on these Gen-Z esque quips to show how eccentric and cold she is. Television and movies seem to have lost the art of ""show, don't tell.""  Catherine Zeta Jones and Luis Guzman were so unsexy, I don't recognize them as Morticia and Gomez. No chemistry.  What's with the teen romance being so prominent here? In Addams Family Values, Wednesday and the outcast boy like each other at the end, but it was more organic, not shoved down our throats from the beginning.  However, aside from this baffling portrayal of Wednesday and the family, it is a well made show. I was able to finish watching the series.

"... there's one thing you can always be sure from Disney, a lot of mud, dull colours, cheap looking sets and poor acting from a host of bit part British tv actors. So far, so grey. Was looking forward to this show as I love 'Rogue One' but it's pretty bloody gloomy and dull so far, it's 24 episodes so let's hope it's just a slow build to a much bigger better adventure. It has the feel of a BBC drama, a lot of talk, limited excitement and a lot of English accents for a show set in an entire galaxy, something I find really annoying as a Brit, I want escapism, not South London. It doesn't feel like Star Wars, it doesn't feel like Rogue One, not sure what it feels like, but time will tell. Is it good, honestly, I've no idea yet.",10,positive
"Engrossing show with gorgeous scenery and horses. Such a good cast of characters! My favorite is Kevin Costner, he's just great, love everything I've ever seen him in. And I love him in Yellowstone too. I think he and Taylor Sheridan work really well together.  But to be honest, I could do without Kayce's wife. It just seems like she nags him too much. She likes making a big deal about things too unnecessarily. I find her to be annoying.  However, I can seriously do without the daughter, Beth. Every scene with her is over the top, and so is her trying to be so tough all the time. I honestly can't stand her negative, bad, sarcastic attitude. It all ruins scenes with her imho. Maybe it would help if Kelly Reilly could reign in on the trying too hard or the overacting.",10,positive
"So, my first review was very succinct....I was in awe about the story, about the shooting, about the scenery....but it's so much more than that....great character evolution, believable story, real family....and then the horses....damn....practical effects all around (I guess?) and great dialogue....must be a great life on a ranch like that lol....would trade instantly to find myself between nature, surrounded by horses and cattle and great open views....I'll get selling my cybersecurity solutions tomorrow...let me dream today :-)",6,neutral
"I really enjoyed the show. Jenna Ortega is a wonderful actress and the casting of the show overall was spot on. Wednesday was perfectly odd & macabre in the ways we know and love.  Despite the rather obvious storytelling beats and twist, I really enjoyed what they did with it. As a whole it seems like everyone had fun.  My one real complaint is this is not an Addams Family show. Wednesday being the focus and the rest of the family, Thing excluded, being relagated to one or two appearances. The family dynamic is very out of character which makes the whole thing feel off. The Addams' are supposed to be full of love and support for eachother. Wednesday would never ""hate"" her parents or dread being like Morticia. Also as much as I think Luiz Guzman was a great casting choice, he didn't bring any of the Charm to Gomez.",4,negative
"The show is not terrible, well a little terrible. Had this show not been under the Addams Family banner, it might have just been another Netflix series, an okay watch. My problem is that they and when I say they I mean Tim Burton, took some iconic characters and distorted them into rather dull and dreary nobodies. Not the first time he has done so, turning the charismatic Willy Wonka into a sinister creep. I have no problem with the casting, but where is the charisma, the joy, the wicked sense of humour that the Addams Family are known for. They revel in the macabre the absurd, I am sure that Morticia and Gomez probably would have chuckled at Wednesday's antics, not sent her to boarding school. The show is way too serious, it went from kooky to emo. I am not saying don't watch the show, you may like it, it has some really good elements, but it is not the Addams.",5,neutral

If they could step back they might see what we see, it's crap. Not one amusing line or situation to be had in the half I saw and that is far enough in to know where this trainwreck is headed.

"I did not like the use of modern political terms. They should be left out no matter whose side you lean towards. It's supposed to be entertainment, not politics. I'm just glad there wasn't a lot of it to completely turn me away.  I also wasn't too fond of the casting for Gomez. I felt his acting was mediocre. They did a good job casting him as his younger self which I will not talk too much about as to avoid spoilers.  I also wasn't fond of Enid. She was too pop culture for my liking. I feel like this series was made for modern teenagers due to the internet terms that are used. Some adults will even like it if they fall in part of modern society, but it certainly wasn't for me.  As for the story, it's interesting. It even has some good dark humor that is reminiscent of the older series. I felt that Jenna Ortega did a good job portraying Wednesday. Also, how can we forget about the dance scene that everyone is talking about? I'm usually not into crime, but I have to say that I was really into in the investigations and trying to figure out the hyde. The last two episodes had me glued to my seat. You'll be in for a surprise.  While it might sound like I disliked this series, I did not. It wasn't bad, but it did have annoying flaws that brought the rating down for me. Even so, I'll still watch the next season.",9,positive

Tim Burton has done an amazing job of expanded on Wednesday character and who she is. Would love to see a second season about this. Definitely recommend. Was just great watching Wednesday grow as a person, how she was finding out more about her self and family. How her minds works and her abiltiy to be so detached from everything and everyone around her and yet making attachments at the same time was just great.",10,positive
"It's really sad when the rights to a franchise are purchased only to have the source material that made the franchise so popular entirely ignored.  The first season was good. Not great. Good. From there the series just seems to continue to drop in quality... exponentially. You could excuse this (not really) by thinking that maybe nobody involved in adapting the source material into a series ever read any of it. Maybe they didn't realize the mistakes they were making. In this case, though, they don't even have that excuse available. The star of the series (Henry) just happens to be a super-fan of the books and the video game adaptation.  I just hope this travesty serves to kill the careers of every writer involved.",10,positive
"This critic text is only about season 1  Andrzej Sapkowski wrote in 1990 ""A lesser evil"" giving birth to Geralt of Rivia. He then wrote a series of short stories about him making some twists about fairy tales or folklore creatures and setting them in his dark fantasy universe. Then he wrote his epic pentalogy of the ""rescue of Ciri"" saga following some of the plot developed in his previous short stories.  I didn't expect the series to be good but boy I was wrong. After all the buzz about the ""political casting"" of a multicultural cast and the precedents of Netflix doing some horrendous work in some adaptations, I was very cautious about this series. And I'm still not ok with some of the casting selection like Merigold Triss among others but generally, the cast is astounding. And they did the most important thing right: the characterization of Geralt of Rivia.  This is a character ridden story and the character of Geralt is one hell of a characterization. I liked the leaked photos of Henry Cavil but more than physically he is the character made life and this was a blessing. Yennefer and Ciri are pretty good (we'll see in the future) and some of the secondaries like Cahir and Renfri are really well done.  The tone, the setting, the strange chronically order and the language is like I imagined it more or less (because I'm not a native english reader and the material was well adapted in Spanish to fit the ""redneck"" language in some characters among other things) but the way they adapted the short stories: ""the witcher"", ""the lesser evil"", ""a question of price"" and others is astounding and perfectly executed.  I would really like to see adapted all the short stories like the doppelganger one among others but I understand the need to adapt this material as a prequel to the ""Ciri saga"" and I also understand the necessary adaptations to the series format which has been done pretty well. The effects, the makeup, the costumes are really well done (well maybe not the nilfgaard armor).  I hope the viewers enjoy this saga as I did and they are not anoyed with the weird timeline. It is the only thing that I can see as a impediment to truly enjoy it.  I devoured the series as I did with the books and I felt hooked again on them.  I can only hope that the adaptation follows with this level and that they continue this good work.",3,negative
"On every level Andor reveals what Star Wars could be. The dialogue is involved, a masterclass of subtext. The characters are nuanced and layered. The plot moves from one event to another organically (aka not using forced contrivances so you can shoehorn in a fight scene). The story is not just trying to give you a fun time but to actually say something.  What do many Star Wars fans say about such a compelling series?  It's boring.  Where's the swinging lightsabers and cameos?? Where is the breakneck pace and the dialogue that spells out exactly what is happening on the screen in front of me? Fans keep saying that Star Wars is dead (in truth it very much is at the moment). But then they get a glimpse of the greatness it could be, and what do they say about it? They don't want that. They want live-action cameos of some obscure character that appeared on that one animated Star Wars show they loved. They want action and lightsabers. And that's about it. Then they wonder why Star Wars is shallow and empty.  I'll give you a hint. It's because you keep coming back for the cameos and lightsabers, but when a true story is told you balk at it, calling it boring.  Andor is probably the best written Star Wars content since Empire Strikes Back. People like to say that about different movies/shows, but here the accolade actually holds up. What made Empire so great anyway? Han Solo and Leia were chased (slowly I might add) through the galaxy. Luke is trained by Yoda...for quite a while. There are a few action set pieces, but in general Empire has a lot of slower moving parts. And it's great for it. It allows the characters to breath, the universe to expand and become more intriguing, and the villains (specifically Vader) to be more menacing and nuanced.  This is exactly what Andor does and does so well. Yet it does it with much more time on its hands. Perhaps that is why it is ""boring."" But the thing about most adult series is that you no longer need flashy scenes to keep your attention. In-depth dialogue and character moments are enough to keep you invested (while the kids fall asleep because they're bored). Andor is quite adult, but in an effortless and natural way. It also has plenty of excitement, which it takes its time building up to. But if you can't be bothered to care about anything other than whether the Emperor makes an appearance or if some Jedi cuts up some bad guys, then this show isn't for you.  In the end, people don't have to love this show. It's completely up for criticism, like any other show/movie (I am giving it 9 stars because a few elements were just a bit off, and I enjoyed a few parts less than others). But simply calling it boring and giving it 1 or 3 stars is not remotely close to a review. I am convinced that if Star Wars could go in the direction of Andor in general, with more mature themes, intricate storytelling, and well-rounded characterization, it would revitalize the entire SW universe. But that will never happen so long as fans are more interested in flash and nostalgia with little substance. Perhaps Andor is too good for SW and it's fandom. Maybe that's why SW as it is today is a hollow shell of what it could be (and what it once was with the Original Trilogy).",8,positive

"I'm almost there wanting to downgrade to 3 or 2 stars. I'm giving it a chance after watching 3rd episode's ending in a hope that anything clever would develop from this series...  Flashbacks of home planet bring somewhat unrealistic picture of forest children society that I just cannot digest.  The planet they live in looks like cheap movie set with used plastic parts from previous Star Wars movies.  So many meaningless characters just confuse me, there is no feeling of story line, drama, characters.  Oh and the trash can robot's voice - what the hell??  Love story. Ugh I don't know. I guess there was some sort of triangle there - they just did not make me care at all - I also wanted (like may others) that guy that reported him to die some gruesome death.  I understand that Star Wars are children safe by design but there are so many grownup fans that it would be beneficial to create some sort of anti-hero series, or ""evil wins"" or insert some blood effects.  I feel like little kid playing with plastic soldiers in Barbies castle. Is this the end of movie industry?",4,negative
"I don't know the games or the books, so I binge watched it all today in one go with fresh eyes. I liked it enough to basically take the day off to do that.  There are many things I really like, Cavill is a great Geralt, grunts a bit too often, but he really seems absorbed into his charachter.  But the timelines keep jumping around back and forth and since people hardly age it is very difficult to understand where in the story we are.  Also most charachters are pretty flat, there are just three charachters that really matter.  Also the show keeps jumping from being something really suitable for adults to something made more for 12 year olds.  The Witcher story seems more suitable for grown ups than for children.  Especially the Harry Potter school parts feel really forced and artificial. And too many other elements like life and intrigue at court are just hinted at. where are 30 years of life at court for yenevere?  For me it works best, when there is a one monster challenge or story central to an episode, releasing the haunted girl from the curse is a good one.  I think if they want to continue with more seasons, they really need to get their timelines right and invest more in interesting dialogue for the side charachters.  Too much is not believable or alludes to other series like Harry Potter which pulls you right out of the witcher.  I do look forward to following this show, but again and gain we see, it is mostly the dialogue, the believability of charachters that carries a show. Production value helps, but first you need a great story.  The witcher has a lot of potential, so I hope they improve.",10,positive

"I think that each episode is very well made and a great experience in itself, but the story in general felt a little bit rushed to me.  Each episode jumps from point A to point B to point C and so on, but with nothing in between. It was supposed to be a very long journey, but it felt kind of fast to me. Other than that, I think the show was really good, a must watch.  I've seen a lot of people complaining that it was different from the game, but I really liked that they went much deeper and did a great job in developing the characters and bringing other characters as well. I actually felt that they could go even further and generate their own story and I hope they do that in the second season.",8,positive
"This show gets better and better. From a ""outcast against the system"" beginning, it's flourishing into a brilliant Cold War drama, with each side of the subterfuge trying to out-fox the other.  An extremely strong cast of bit-part characters, all fleshed out wonderfully in their own small way, added with really strong, intelligent, grown up dialogue which never once wanders into cliche.... It's simply the best TV series Star Wars has produced.  Really really great stuff. Compelling from start to finish.  Special mention goes to Genevieve O'Reilly (Mon Mothma), Denise Gough and Stellan Skarsgard who just chew up the dialogue and make compelling watching.",9,positive
"The series is Incredible. Not a moment wasted in any episode. Every word has meaning and every action is important, or leads to something important. Not one minute of this show has disappointed.

"Blood, black and white, dark, and monsters ... All of these terms lead us to Wednesday !! ... I just finished the dark comedy fantasy series Wednesday. What an amazing miniseries . Thanks for Netflix ofc and the the amazing director who made this amazing series . First of all if u didn't watch Wednesday this is ( don't worry there is no spoilers ) this series talks about a weird dark girl calls Wednesday addams and her adventure with the Unknown monster . I loved the plot so much it was unique and completely amazing . The cast was amazing and cool and I the most three characters I loved are Wednesday, ennid and Tyler but , I just wished if the actor who did the Tyler's character acted more stronger especially in last episodes . The third thing I love is the effects of the movie were so real like when u watch it sounds to you real and full of logics . I think there will be another season for this series , its clear ofc and I hope . I advise you to watch this series especially with your family . And there is a little or u can say small scenes that are not allowed for kids ofc but they are like short only 10 seconds and meybe less . I give this series 9 out of 10 only because some actors should acted more stronger , well I hope in season 2.",8,positive

"I think it's the best thing that's come out of star wars since the original trilogy. We can't take any more of these predictable scripts that seem to be written by an artificial intelligence. Finally, a writing that doesn't sound like fan film writing. It is a realistic, epic, dramatic, story playing on one of the most interesting themes of the saga: the oppression exercised by a dictatorial regime.  So my main praise goes to the writing, which in this franchise often (unfortunately) sucks. We will not see the usual jedi, who have now completely lost the realistic side present in the original trilogy and have redundant superpowers that look like something out of a Marvel movie. Instead, we will see realistic, believable characters and a plot that is finally new.  One amazing thing present in this series: the are ""real"" dialogue that works. That is! The dialogues don't just take the plot from point A to point B. There are characters with personalities and the dialogues *really* reflect them!  Oh and finally there is no fanservice. I mean, no ""spectacular"" appearances of famous characters. No characters aged or rejuvenated with special effects. No such crap.  The rest also does not disappoint. Nice characters, very good acting and cinematography.  It almost seems as if someone created a real new gem, instead of copying from the past and pocketing fans' money.",5,neutral

Now why do they have to associate a strong woman as an unsffurable one like Ellie and make the Joel a pushover. Example of a likeable strong woman Laura Croft, Ripley and Sarah Connor.  Also what is it with episode 3, why they have to include a gay couple just for the sake and they have no relevance to the plot?",7,neutral
"Started watching the series on Sunday night at about 7, by Monday night I had watched all 8 episodes. That is how absorbing the show/story is. The story is brilliant and the performances from all the actors are excellent. A special shout out has to however go out to Jenna Ortega who is absolutely amazing as Wednesday. She must win awards for the truly absorbing performance that she produces.  Then there is 'Think'. How the show includes 'Think' and uses him to such a great effect is just inspiring. Like I previously said the story is amazing with lots of misleads and misdirection's throughout the series. The writers should be proud of what they came up with and hopefully a second series has to be in the pipeline. A must watch for everyone!",10,positive
"I enjoyed this show, even better than the last two of the three Starwars movies. Mando is great and I find him so mysterious and interesting which speaks to the actor's and writers' talent because you cannot see his face or facial expressions for the majority of the show. However, I was surprised to see this show as one of the highest rated shows of all time. Almost like by simply being a Starwars production gave the show some slightly undeserved rating cred. The production budget appears low based on the simple background scenery and lack of background characters. However, I Did enjoy the actors and the characters. The storyline is good, but could have been built up a little bit more. I did find the show good and I'm looking forward to season 2.  ****update- half way through season 2 and so far, it's a 9 series rating for me.",10,positive

Compare to some of the most popular movies: Titanic at 7.7, It's a Wonderful Life at 8.2, and it even beats The Matrix at 8.7!  I found The Handmaid's Tale to be absolutely terrifying, for the most chilling reason: it most certainly could happen! In fact, I read that the book author only included things that actually HAVE happened. I don't care which way you lean, this series will make you value the freedoms we so often take for granted and stay ""woke"" to guarding those freedoms.  The script, acting, filming, etc., are all magnificent!  So ignore the terrible reviews and watch this series!",10,positive
"I have been a fan of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels. I have read every single one of them. Child's creation of a unique American character doing good as he travels the Country, captured my imagination and I look forward to his next novel.  The Amazon video version is as good as a book to video conversion can get. It captures Reacher's essence and character ticks. All of the things that make Reacher, Reacher are here. Yeah, he frequently takes his short off, but that is for the women. It certainly got my Wife to stop complaining that I was watching something violent. It also gives Reacher a dry sense of humor.  I sat there with a big smile in my face during the two episodes I watched. I am a fan.  This series follows Child's first Reacher story. It was so long age I cannot honestly say I remember the details. Two episodes in I can say it works.  The best part of this series is that it helps replace the mental stain of a diminutive Tom Cruise playing the part of someone whose character is based on being a huge, strong man.  I highly recommend this for anyone who like action or detective films.",8,positive

"A luxury resort where it's always sunny for shady people - ""The White Lotus"" is a hilarious blend of satire and dark humor that exposes the anxieties, neuroses, and peculiars of its privileged characters.  A talented ensemble cast makes this series a character study like no other. It's a show where you might not want to invite the guests to dinner, but watching them unravel is undeniably captivating. The writing is sharp, the visuals are stunning, and the music perfectly sets the tone for a journey that's both funny and unsettling.  What makes ""The White Lotus"" truly special is its ability to balance humor and cynicism without ever resorting to disdain for its characters. Instead, it invites viewers to form their own judgments, making for a viewing experience that's both thought-provoking and wildly entertaining. If you enjoy satire that bites, this is your paradise and nightmare bundled together.",8,positive

I really couldn't take another The Walking Dead clone, which, in general, sucks and should have never been made, but, unfortunately, it did.",8,positive
"Firstly, I disagree with the reviewers who say season 1 is better than season 2. I just finished watching both back-to-back, and to my mind season 2 is considerably better. In the first season, the three main characters all lack charisma, which is a big problem, and there is a lot of plainly hammy acting. That's to say nothing of the hokey, predictable but at the same time, hugely overcomplicated and turgid plot. Almost all the action scenes are unbelievable, the bad guys are caricatures, the dialogue is wordy and unrealistic - there are just so many problems. Indeed, I almost gave up on it halfway through the season, but persisted for some reason, and it did improve a little later on. But overall I could only give it 6 out of 10 at best.  Season 2 has a more professional sheen. The actors - particularly Ritchson, who plays Reacher - seem more comfortable in their roles, and some of the action scenes are quite entertaining. Midway through the season, the screenwriters seem to have found their groove, there are some genuinely funny lines, and the characters even seem to be growing a little. Unfortunately though, the season deteriorates sharply toward the end, with the plot and action scenes becoming steadily more absurd until the final battle with the main villain, which is outright ludicrous. The final episode indeed was a huge disappointment and left me feeling quite ripped off after investing all that time in the series.  Some reviewers have also mentioned their unease with Reacher's killings, and in the second season, he does indeed engage in several outright murders, which can leave one feeling somewhat ambivalent. What is probably more disturbing though, is the depiction of his ethos - he is supposed to be a thoroughly righteous man, but he acts at times more like a psychopathic killing machine. It doesn't help that Ritchson as an actor doesn't have a huge emotional range. I mean, there is the basis of a compelling character in there somewhere, but one feels the creators of the series just haven't gotten the balance right somehow. Maybe the original books did a better job - certainly, many reviewers seem to think so, but I've never read them.  Overall, I was heading toward giving season 2 a 7 out of 10, but the disappointment of the last couple of episodes reduced it to a 6. It's still better than season 1 though.",10,positive
"Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni know what the fans are looking for and know how to approach it!  The new trilogy after Disney acquired Star Wars was awful. Terrible oversight, incoherent, and messy beyond belief. Yes they made money, but it ruined so much for many Star Wars fans.  The Mandalorian captures the true essence of what fans expect to see. A western style series full of adventure, humor, and BABY YODA!  If you're a fan of the Clone Wars animated series and Rebels, it is a MUST. Bringing the universe to life, Favreau and Filoni need to be overlooking the whole Star Wars Universe for Disney.  It is the way!",10,positive

For instance, when someone asks a question (especially with the handmaids) they just stare blankly for 20 seconds before mumbling a couple words. Or when they are supposed to be in a hurry to get away, the character always takes their time saying goodbye or again staring blankly at something. Or when they are told to do something , it takes them like 40 seconds to start moving.  I like that the show does more showing without words than telling, but at the same time, these characters should be acting like there is a much bigger sense of urgency than they do.",7,neutral
"A Sociological and human nature-related series , very realistic and reflecting the worst of us and the best of us.  Scary, inspiring, violent, and yet full of Heart felt for sure  Unbelievable acting. I've been around the block (I'm 62) this is 10 out of ten acting and plot.  The calm voice of the Mandalorian actor showing human transformation compassion and true human strength is possible , to the intelligence, and adaptability of children (she's consistently awesome).  A must see binge. I'm grateful for this enriching series and thank you so much. Watch it save it and talk about it. Very very intelligent with the right balance of excitement tempered with the best that humanity has to offer.  My review Zero spoilers and very vague with intent :)",10,positive
"This episode was so nuanced and masterly crafted! It kept me on the edge of my seat until the credits ran. Excellent storytelling and photography around the stars of the episode, Bill and Frank, and terrific character development and dynamics with Joel and Ellie.  It's media moments like these that should bring people together -- the love shared between two people, the challenges grieving a deep, personal loss places on a new, otherwise hopeful relationship, persevering against all odds, and staying loyal to the one who has your six.  Wow... just wow! I don't event watch a lot of TV, but a friend suggested I see Episode 3, and it will be long before I forget how it made me feel.",10,positive
"I'll start by saying I enjoy the cast, particularly Kelly Reilly, who delivers a riveting performance. Cole Hauser is also entertaining, though it feels like he doesn't have to ""perform"" much to fit his role-there's just something magnetic about him. If he were shirtless, he could deliver all the ""cowboy wisdom"" he wanted, and I'd still be glued to the screen.  The directing is also solid, adding a cinematic quality to every scene. But here's the thing-I can't quite get on board with the story or the characters. These are genuinely awful people: wealthy, morally flexible landowners whose ethics and standards seem to change with every season. They spend most of their time fighting even more despicable people, all in the name of ""keeping the land,"" though it often feels like it's more about ego than any higher purpose. Murder, torture, and double standards define them, yet they act as if they're the heroes of the story.  What comes across is almost an indictment of how nothing in America works as it should. And, in an odd way, the show seems to subtly justify violence and the casual use of guns, often for reasons that feel thin at best. It's surprising this series has become such a massive hit, and that it hasn't faced more scrutiny for its messaging.",8,positive
"As someone very familiar with the books - and in original at that, some games and also having a painful and regrettable memory of the original tv show (this one is not the first attempt...), I thoroughly enjoyed it.  First of all, do not be fooled - this tv show is not ""faithful to the books"". And this is it's simultaneously it's greatest strength and it's greatest weakness. Obviously source material is vast and it needed to be condensed into several episodes, and choice of the stories is not difficult, when we have to introduce main characters and the connections between them. But the flashbacks are virtually indistinguishable from the main story line (as in the saga, in contrast to stories/flashbacks, which as books were anthologies of stories... to some extent), and I'm pretty sure this will make somewhat difficult to follow the events for ""vanilla"" viewers. There are some things that are unique to this show only, but understandable: books understated and left a lot to the imagination of the reader, and Author intended it that way. Anyway... That's one star taken away from perfect 10. I personally like it that way, but I agree with other reviews: someone in production should be sacked.  Henry Cavill from now is Geralt for me. Forever. His performance is now eternal. Of course good material helps immensely, but this match is perfect. Some other actors are also excellent, but overall... cast could be better. Acting of the lower quality characters is also a problem. That's another star detracted.  I must be honest though - these are ""technical"" issues, which in no way make the show bad. Just... slightly less perfect.",8,positive
"I see other people complaining here about this series being full of tropes and for teenagers...It's clear that it has a target audience, but I don't see why this has to be bad. I think this is very decent and entertaining if you enjoy teen/YA themes. In literature or TV, what makes a great work is not that the topic has to be super-original...most of the times the greatness lies in the execution. And Wednesday is well made. The goth atmosphere is a fresh approach, the actors are great, the cinematography is good... The only thing I didn't like is that the villain is heavily hinted from early in the game, it would have been more fun if they kept us guessing a bit more, the surprise factor was taken from this revelation. Otherwise, I really enjoyed watching and I hope there are more seasons.",7,neutral
"I would give Season 1 a seven and Season 2 a six, so combining up to give a seven. And just finishing Season 3, I'd give that a 7, so stand by a 7 rating overall.  Season 1 had much more of a contrast of class between the rich customers staying at the White Lotus Hawaii and the little people that are on staff to serve their every whim. It was much more grounded in those elements versus the much - much - darker turn that Season 2 in Sicily that took a kind of creepy turn. Both season has that catty, voyeuristic nature of ogling the rich just to see them as not all that. The show tries to make us, the little people watching, feel smug about how the rich aren't different, yet they are - they have money!  The most redeeming feature of both seasons - Jennifer Coolidge as Tanya. Tanya just pulls it off as being clueless yet sympathetic with an equal part pathos and humor without having her come off as pathetic. Her scenes made up for some of the other lame story lines.  4/7/25. Finished binging Season 3 over 3 days, and it was better than Season 2 and about as good as Season 1. Yet, the biggest detraction, this could have been done in 4 to 6 episodes, not 8. Way, way too much filler.  Enjoyable, particularly the first season.",7,neutral
"A simple yet interesting murder mystery series , with some good fantasy and teen drama stuff . Series was inspired from the old show ""The Addams Family"" . Main positive of the series was characters and its characterisation , especially Wednesday Addams .  Jenna Ortega as Wednesday was impressive and nailed it .  Other cast did a great job and well supported to their respective characters . Series gave me Harry Potter kinda vibe . Murder investigation was simple but that part was well written and never makes is bore . Except for the clumsy 3rd act in finale episode , series had good direction and good production value . Visuals were great . Overall an entertaining Fantasy investigation teen drama to watch . If you like to watch Harry Potter kinda content then definitely give a try .",7,neutral
"Wow. Is it ironic, or just pathetic, that even in 2017 a TV adaptation of a feminist novel still has to have a young and beautiful actress (Yvonne Strahovski, born 1982) play a character - ""the Commander's Wife"" - who, in the novel, has to be at least late 40's/early 50's. And the Commander, who was white-haired in the book, is played by Joseph Fiennes. I'm surprised Margaret Atwood didn't turn up on set with an uzi.",9,positive
"If you are watching this expecting it to have anything in common with The Addams Family other than the name, you will be disappointed. Rather than being the odd, creepy, but loving daughter and sister of the TV show, comics and movies, Wednesday is an obnoxious, two dimensional, know it all pain in the rear. She has been turned into the stereotypical good at everything, smarter than the adults, ""strong"" female lead that Hollywood can't help churning out. Hopefully, the writers will add more depth to her character as the series goes on. Until them, the series is a disappointment to anyone familiar with the original Addams Family.",8,positive
I really like this show and I think it really feels like Star Wars. Nothing more needs to be said.,10,positive
"I'll make the similarities with Succession. Yellowstone has more action, especially around the cattle rustling scenes. There is also more violence, physical and guns. You'll see characters with bruised faces....and worse. Actually I probably should be comparing with Peaky Blinders. Both shows push the boundaries of 'gritiness' and aren't afraid to put their characters into dire physical and mental situations. Now back to Succession. Succession is cleverer and focuses solely on the 'rich' family. Yellowstone does spend time with the cowboys and actually the show is better when it does as these are some excellent characters. Yellowstone is also more 'soap opery' than Succession. Up to you whether that is good or not.  Also need to mention Kelly Reilly's character, Beth Dutton, she is one of the best female characters on television at the moment.  I know that the scenery isn't really Montana but it is really spectacular and gives the show a cinematic feel.  I was expecting this to be a bit like Longmire but other than both being modern Westerns there isn't really much similarity.",5,neutral
"As I catch up with Yellowstone. - now ending Season 2. - it occurs to me that everything about the story and how it is presented is half again outsized from what we see as normal. The story is bigger than we can get our head around. The actions that take place connect in a way that one huge scene is preceded immediately huge scene by the next. Plots are on the edge of believability but not quite totally BS. And of course, it is set in Big Sky Country - an outsized state. We don't like the Duttons. But we dislike them less than all others -- the politicians, the Fish and Wildlife Service, Asian tourists, Native American Schools and impulsive Native Americans, developers, city slickers, etc.. I am enjoying it... for all it's almost-absurdist grandeur.",10,positive
"I understand that Kevin Costner left the show, and I can appreciate that this required adjustments to the storyline. However, the way the plot and characters were handled in the final season feels incredibly lazy. Episodes swing between being dull and irrelevant to the story, and then abruptly pushing the narrative forward by sacrificing the depth and humanity of the characters.  Instead of staying true to who these characters were, they were turned into exaggerated versions of themselves, performing extreme actions without any realistic consequences. This lack of accountability and rushed pacing made the story feel superficial and disconnected.  It's as though the showrunners were desperate to wrap things up quickly, but in doing so, they lost what made the series so compelling in the first place: complex, human characters navigating a rich, believable world. The ending leaves too much unresolved, and rather than a satisfying conclusion, it feels like a careless rush to the finish line.",10,positive
"I have to confess that I started watching Peaky Blinders a while back, and stopped a few episodes in. That's why this review is a little out of date. I can't remember why exactly I stopped watching. I remember thinking that it was very good. Perhaps I got distracted by life or by another show or I stopped watching television for a while, which is something I tend to do every so often. I love to read, and television shows can eat up so much time that I need to just stop and get back to my books every now and then. I have to confess as well that I only went back to watching Peaky Blinders because I found out that Tom Hardy was in the show, starting with the second season. Those of you who know me know that my obsession with Tom Hardy has gone far beyond a mere man crush to bordering on psychotic fixation. I honestly do believe that Hardy has, in a very short amount of time, gone from being just another great British actor to becoming one of the most dangerous and brilliant actors of this generation. He's also pretty enough to make me question my heterosexuality, just a little bit. Okay, more than just a little bit. The level of Hardy's acting ability is very much on display in his appearances on Peaky Blinders, where, as Alfie Solomons, a London Jewish mobster, Hardy practically explodes off of the small screen with a dangerous, impulsive and unpredictable character. His performance here is reminiscent of a young Gary Oldman, Gerard Depardieu or Jack Nicholson at the beginning of their careers. Hardy steals every scene that he's in, in the same way that those great actors did in their youth. This is no small feat, given that most of Hardy's scenes are with Cillian Murphy, the lead actor in Peaky Blinders. Murphy will be familiar to film audiences from performances in Batman Begins, Red Eye and Inception (Which also includes Tom Hardy), just to mention a few. He is one of those great British film industry actors, and is at his very best as Tommy Shelby and carries the weight of a very complex character in a very complex show superbly. The show itself is about a family run gang in Birmingham shortly after the end of World War 1. It is based very loosely on an actual gang from that time, whose name came from their practice of placing razor blades in the caps of their hats to use as a way of blinding enemies in a fight. The story centers on three half Gypsy brothers coming back from the horrors of the war and establishing their power, led by Tommy, the brains of the outfit. All of the actors in Peaky Blinders are superb, from supporting leads to secondary and even minor characters. The real discovery for me was Helen McCrory as the Shelby boys' Aunt, Polly. In the first season McCrory is just another very strong supporting actor. It is in the second season that her character is given much more to deal with, and we begin to see Judy Dench like moments of such startling sophistication and delicacy that I found myself wondering how I had never heard of her before. The only thing that I did know about her is that she is married to Damian Lewis of Homeland and Band of Brothers fame (Also one of the actors considered to be competition for Idris Elba and Tom Hardy for the James Bond Role...) and that she had been in a Harry Potter movie.. McCrory is absolutely stunning in this role and so are so many other actors. The writing, by Steven Knight, most recently of Taboo fame, is superb and powerful and the show has the same kind of dark intensity as Taboo. The third season does start off with more slack than the first two seasons, largely because the characters are in a very different situation than we have seen them in up until that point, but the tension returns as the season continues and, at the risk of bordering on a spoiler warning, I can tell you that, by the end of the third season you will very much need to see the next season. I don't know why I stopped watching Peaky Blinders the first time. I must have had a reason. But, whatever that reason was, I was definitely wrong. Peaky Blinders is excellent. It is television at its very best, which is saying one hell of a lot nowadays, with so much fantastic TV out there. Don't just watch it because Tom Hardy is in it. Although that is a very good reason to watch anything. Watch Peaky Blinders because it is a damn good show. And Tom Hardy is the bonus. Granted, Tom Hardy is one hell of a bonus. But Peaky Blinders is more than worth watching in and of itself. And don't make the mistake that I did, of only watching a few episodes. The more you watch of Peaky Blinders the more impressive it becomes. It is, in a few words, more than binge worthy. I personally can't wait for season 4...",8,positive
"Henry Cavill is the Witcher. The plot jumping was very annoying, it made it very difficult to follow the storyline. Other than this, the show is good.

"I love it , enjoyed every bit of it, there could've been a better casting for morticia and Gomez . But overall . Amazing work!! Jenna Ortega is sensational, and the mood shifts from completely dark, to softening up . Her choreography , insane !!! And I didn't like how they portrayed pugsley, because that's not how he is , they made him out to be a wimp , which is not true . I know it's more related to the characters in the comics back in the 1930's , but still I think Johnny depp and Eva green would've made the best morticia and Gomez Addams. The chemistry and the acting would""ve been insane .",10,positive
"The pilot of the 'Last of Us' is one of the best pilots I've ever watched. It is a seriously exciting, terrifying and emotional episode of television.  The world presented here is fascinating and feels authentic as a post apocalyptic society.  I feel this series had so many interesting paths it COULD have taken.  The first few episodes set the perfect scene. Some felt episode 3 'Long, long time' derailed the series but I personally loved it. It was 'real life' inside this new world. It was a beautiful love letter to human relationships.  However, as the series went on, I felt the episodes were rushed.  The dialogue was cheesy at times. The characters and the relationships weren't developed enough.  The action fell away and the focus became telling too many half hearted stories.  The penultimate episode was well paced and the performances were excellent but in the end I'm left unsatisfied by the finale.  I have hopes for season 2 and won't give up watching yet!",7,neutral

"As a huge fan of the Reacher books I was really excited to see this series. I thoroughly enjoyed the Tom Cruise movies. It's a testament to Cruise's talent that he could make it work despite being nothing like the the stature of the character. Now of course Alan Ritchson has the physique and menace of the character, and he does a pretty good job on the acting front. I'd like to see more in the next series though, Ritchson is a bit one dimensional. I don't know if the director and writer wanted it that way but without more depth to the performance it won't hold the attention for too many more seasons and that would be a real shame. Over all I thoroughly enjoyed this and the supporting performances were superb.",7,neutral

I hope this series isn't one that suddenly ends I look forward to another at least 5 or more series and the same For the prequel.  There are one or to characters that sit in the cast I'd like to See more of , jimmy's story I particularly like , looking forward to seeing his return to the Dutton ranch , though I hope the story isn't winding down his character as I see his journey could see him leaving .

One thing is clear, money doesn't make you happy ans if you need to sell your soul for the money of the rich, doesn't make you happy either.  I highly recommend this show when you like to watch atmospheric productions which make you uncomfortable while you're watching. Can't wait for the episode!",9,positive
"A solid show, I like it. I wouldn't compare Reacher with detective shows like The Bridge or Criminal Minds - it reminds me rather of Banshee (2013), with a little lower action and violence level. Anyway, so far Reacher is a decent show, nothing ueber-good but quite entertaining.",8,positive
"This show was great, had all of the dark and morbid humor of the original Addams Family shows and movies. This show was equally enjoyable for my teenaged daughter, my 70 year old mom, and me.  The casting was done very well with one exception.  Really, my only criticism of the movie was that Luis Guzman was an unfortunate choice to play Gomez- not smooth and suave enough to play the part, he made Gomez kind of bumbling and was hard to watch next to Catherine Zeta Jones who was perfect in the role of Morticia... Interesting storyline, plot twists, funny and engaging. I binged the whole show in a few nights.",7,neutral

"I really had not heard of this series unt I heard all the Emmy buzz and after the wins I watched. From the beginning of the credits I loved every minute of this series and found the acting just enticing . I truly spent the whole series speculating who dies and was shocked at the demise. Some of the characters are quite deplorable and others bring a lightness. Jennifer Coolidge shines, Murray Bartlett , Steve Zahn and the several episodes that Molly Shannon appears are fantastic. It is quite graphic in several scenes for those who are faint of heart May need to be warned. I was especially fond of the soundtrack.",10,positive
"The whole cast is superb, the only thing that raised an eyebrow was the casting for Gomez, Lucia played a really good part, however the character was tall, dark and handsome, overall this is a definite watch and also a definite 10, waiting for season 2, TIM Burton does not direct all of the episodes. Jenna Ortega was simply brilliant, casting could not have got this more right, she was amazing, cannot imagine anyone else that could have played Wednesday as well as Jenna Ortega. Katherine Zeta Jones, gorgeous as ever and another perfect fit for mortician, hope that we see more of her and unclear fester in the next series.",9,positive
"I had to change my rating after season 2. I changed it from 10 to a generous 8. It was nice to see the witcher as a lonely hero fighting with monsters etc as was the case in season1. Of course it was to be expected that he would change a bit after Ciri. I did expect that Ciri would be a kind of daughter to him. I didn't expect though such a luck of wisdom from him. Attachment and love is not the same thing. I mean, come on, he is hundreds of years old and he turns into a very possessive and oppressive father?  In the last episode of season2 there is a twist which is the most crazy and outrageous thing. These people must be really desperate to put in something so ridiculous.  Also have in mind that the episodes are not made by the same director. I bet season 3 will be terrible. I expect more psychological problems, conflicts, ridiculous plot etc instead of good story and adventure.",6,neutral
"I used to be a huge Marvel fan but then the Mandalorian happened and immediately change my mind. This is how Star Wars is meant to be. With space ships and tons of different planets I don't know how Mando can remember all of that. What I really love about the Mandalorian is that it makes stormtroopers look half decent. In the movies Han Solo and the others can take care of Stormtroopers like they're nothing and TIE fighters are completely useless, but in The Mandalorian getting chased by a TIE fighter is a BIG deal. I'm really looking forward to see what Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni are going to do next.",9,positive

"This anthology series takes us on a fun and slightly disturbing adventure set in magnificent locations.  It is secured in quality by it's depth of each character and it's fluency of scenes.  The two main characters that obviously need to be mentioned are Jennifer Coolidge as Tanya Marqoid and Murray Bartlett as Armand in my opinion.  Cooldige plays the neurotic and insecure grieving oddball that craves attention and plays it to a tee.  Bartlett plays the high tense resort manager like is life depends on it and is one moment away from a total meltdown.  Both characters one prime time emmys for their role.  The rest of the cast and series is made up of modern day characters which you love to hate, with only one charater that comes across as "" normal"" in my opionn, but I'll let you decide.  Overall a very watchable series and I want to see at least one more season of this quirky and hip story.",6,neutral

"White Lotus Season 3 is a stunning, emotional masterpiece set in breathtaking Thailand. The scenery is serene, yet contrasts the inner chaos of each character. Rick's journey was powerful, Chelsea's heartbreak felt real, and the Buddhist themes added rich depth. Though slower-paced, it allowed more thoughtful reflection. The cinematography was dreamlike, the acting top-notch. It's both satirical and deeply human. The ending? Beautifully haunting. This season didn't just entertain-it moved me. Easily my favorite of the series. I am very much looking forward to season 4 of white lotus and where we got to next!",7,neutral

At first was a little hard to adapt to the new actors (Gomez, Morticia) but it all takes perfect shape and everyone seems to find their place. Great mystery, plenty of dark, dry humor and one or two inside jokes for us older folk that were fans of the original series. Hope they continue this series. Jenna Ortega channels Wednesday Addams so perfectly and seems to just naturally be the perfect fit for the role. The added bits of teen drama fit nicely through the story and aren't forced or stereotypical gunk that is usually added to pander to an age group. Really enjoying this series.",7,neutral

The acting is great, Pedro Pascal is perfect casting carrying over his Mandalorian energy with a Texas twist. The girl actress is great, too.  One aspect I find a bit far fetched is the use of cordycepts mushrooms as the catalyst. They simply wouldn't infect humans (check out Paul Stamet's social media post breaking down this concept) and I think the mycelium popping out of the shroom zombie mouths is a bit goofy and overly gross.

Let's hope they can manage to keep the same lvl of storytelling in season 2. Diego Luna, Stellan, Denise Gough, Alex Lawther. Really gave it all and I'm so looking forward to the next season.

I really liked the way the world gets infected, clever idea and it touches on logic in a way, especially against an unopposed enemy. The series is not a frantic and boring zombie attack but a character development series that plays with loss and emotions quite a bit. I'd say it's closer to the reality of a pandemic than a repeated attack by the living dead. Anyway it would be boring if there was only action and monotony. The shows that did that have been gone for 20 years, maybe they'll come back when the industry gets bored and people want a lot of action with no character explanation.",6,neutral

"(Review updated after Season 6).  Birmingham, England, 1919. In the aftermath of WW1, the Shelby family are making a name for themselves as bookmakers, racketeers and gangsters. Nominally the head of the family is the oldest brother, Arthur, but the real brains, ambition and drive in the organisation lies with Tommy, the second oldest. He will carve out an empire for himself that will stretch beyond Birmingham. This with the aid of his family and his gang, the Peaky Blinders.  Superb drama, created and written by Steven Knight. Gritty, realistic, intriguing and highly entertaining. Some great machinations, subterfuges, plots and counter-plots plus a good amount of action and human drama. Think The Sopranos set in the UK in 1919.  Some very clever storylines and plot developments. They sometimes threaten to become implausible and random (especially as the series goes on) but have a way of fitting together and all making sense at the end.  Great work by the main performers: Cillian Murphy, Helen McCrory, Paul Anderson, Sophie Rundle and Joe Cole. The secondary/guest performances include some big names: Sam Neill, Tom Hardy, Aiden Gillen, Adrien Brody, Noah Taylor. Tom Hardy is the pick of the bunch, as Alfie Solomons.  Great soundtrack too. Though set in the early-20th century, the music is mostly rock, and it works. Despite being anachronistic, the music works, giving the series an edgy feel. It starts with the theme track - Nick Cave's excellent 'Red Right Hand', a song that seems to fit Tommy Shelby perfectly. It continues with the scene-specific music and includes some great tracks. For example, in one episode alone you have Radiohead's 'Climbing Up The Walls', Joy Division's 'Atmosphere' and Black Sabbath's 'War Pigs'.  In addition, the show went out on a high, while it was still quality viewing. By Season 5 cracks were starting to appear: the plot in Season 5 was a bit loose and unfocused and ends rather clumsily, compared to previous seasons. Still great, but not as good as previous seasons and a sign that it had run its course.  The worry then was that Steven Knight would just phone it in for a few seasons to milk more money out of it and just end up ruining the legacy of the show. However, Season 6 is a great finale: focused, short and sharp, wrapping things up in style.",7,neutral
"Superbly put together in every way. Cast of characters, so diverse with carefully chosen cast expertly placed. The master himself, Kevin Costner delivering yet another superb performance. I could go on but the superlatives have temporarily abandoned me. I'm halfway through season 2 and cannot wait to continue. Enjoy the show.",9,positive
"D'Addario was the only character I liked. Oh yeah, the spa lady too. Although both ended up pathetic in the end. Everyone else was just awful! Why make every character so despicable? The blonde daughter? Needed her to never speak again. I understand flawed human nature, but sheesh, are people really that deeply rotten? I found myself angry & annoyed throughout most of it....but constantly hoping things would ""right"" themselves naturally at the end. There's plenty of real-life TV to keep me angry! Would just like to be entertained for a change. What a disappointment.",2,negative
"This might be a kid's show, but if you grew up watching Addam Family then you as an adult will love this show also (I KNIW I DID!) It explains why Wedbesday acts like she does and I could relate to her! It's a show the entire family can set down and watch together and this day and time that's rare. I was called weird and crazy in high school bc I can see the dead. Just bc someone is different doesn't mean you have a free ticket to put them down and make them feel bad about themselves. Especially the females.... I never understood why you feel like you have to compete with one another, .. Respect.",1,negative
"A big reason you may watch, or not, is if you like Alan Ritchson's character Reacher. For me it's a likable portrayal of the cunning wolf who has a heart hidden by his ability to dispense final justice with cold efficiency. That's pretty much why I watched as much of the rest of the Reacher cast and story wasn't as good. Think a veiled remake of Walking Tall and you can sense the mix of good and not so good. Reacher aspires for realism but goes off from that quite often. With a really tight and real story the character of Reacher would be fully realized. In the end, good not great.",10,positive
"I've never read the books or played the games, but I really like this show. It has very good world building and characters. Henry does a really good job with his character and so has other actors. Can't wait for Season 2 and more adventures to watch. The little issue I have is the change of characters like Triss for example. I only saw the game character and there a big changed there that I wish didn't happen.",10,positive
"If you enjoy watching shows like the above mentioned, you'll be delighted with Wednesday. That includes: teen drama, plot holes, basic dumb characters, and more! Oh, and everything looks glossy and plastic, from the characters and their clothes, to the sets and every object in them. Fake.  I have to admit though, from the trailers and press images I kinda knew what I was getting into, but still had high hopes because of Jenna Ortega and Tim Burton being involved in this. But it didn't turn out good, for me at least. Burton has, unfortunately but most certainly, lost his touch. Everything he puts out nowadays is sprinkled with oversaturated images, bad CGI, plastic looking people, costumes and sets, and strangely enough, a very childish energy. And they all feel empty, like there was no passion in making them. If you don't believe me just go check movies like Dark Shadows, Miss Peregrine, and Dumbo. They all look the same, and they feel the same. Granted I still enjoy Dark Shadows a lot, and I think Big Eyes is a pretty solid film, but still.  Enid Sinclair is the personification of everything I have just typed. Incredibly colourful, plastic looking, annoying, and childish. Larissa Weems, the headmistress at Nevermore (what even is that name?), serves as another perfect example. What is the point with having characters like this? They feel generic, and they look generic, and they are too basic, and kept taking me out of it.  Wednesday Addams started off great, but turned into just another generic character pretty quickly. Can we please have strange, unhinged characters and just appreciate them for what they are? Why are they trying to make her ""normal""? I get it a character needs to have depth and some development to them, but that doesn't mean she should start acting all sweet and ""normal"" all of a sudden. She's not. That's the point. Stop ruining everything. I LOVED Jenna Ortega's performance though, I'll give the show that.  Anyway that's more or less all I wanted to say. I don't get they hype behind Wednesday, people are literally going crazy over what is really just another generic, plastic looking, teen Netflix drama. If you can call 'that' drama.",10,positive
"I don't understand the negative reviews, and some almost tainted my view of the show, so my advice is just go into it without reading what other people think. It's overall great, it's entertaining...isn't that why we watch?? Is it perfect? No. Monica is a bit annoying. Jaime is frustrating to watch. I do love Beth, but sometimes you're like ""just chill out."" But I didn't want this to end. I felt like I was a part of the ranch and these were my friends. I'm a big fan of succession-lots of similarities. Watch it!!",10,positive

"For people of a certain age, Star Wars is a part of the bedrock of our childhood.  I am of a certain age and I was a kid in the 1980s watching the original trilogy on a VHS repeat loop.  It feels like Gilroy & Co have actually tapped into that original nostalgia, but have delivered us (people of a certain age) a story with nuance and intelligence that fits with the age that those 70's and 80's kids now find themselves at.  Had I watched the content of Andor in 1987 I would not have understood it, or liked it and would probably have dismissed it.  That is the genius of this show, and probably this was the punt/pitch that Gilroy & Co made to the Disney executives, ""hey lets make an intelligent, exciting, modern style thriller of a TV Show that can stand up to the likes of 'Sopranos' and Breaking Bad' but make it fit within the context of an idea that was created nearly 50 years ago that really appealed to kids and young people at that time - those kids have grown up now, and they would love this""  This does not pander to a Disney agenda of trying to make a new generation of Star Wars fans using a valuable Intellectual Property and make it a current generation friendly piece of work, but actually they have delivered a piece of captivating television, a piece of television that would stand-up on its own if delivered outside of the Star Wars universe.  That's the genius, it gives us 80's kids the same, if not, a better a TV series drama that we expect in this modern age, but perfectly and expertly dovetails it like a master carpenter into the same beauty of aesthetic that we loved as children.  So I echo the sentiment of others that have made the same call, thank you for allowing me to be in my late 40's and enjoy a TV show and feel like I am 8 years old at the same time!  If you asked another person to give you that experience, they would most likely suggest you need to seek self-delusion or magic!  For me this was magic!",6,neutral

"I have just finished season 4 and gone back and rewatched the entire series again. It's only when you can watch it in quick succession do you realise how exceptional this show really is. I have been a fan from day one and whilst you would not call this an enjoyable watch it is totally enthralling. The characters, the acting, the storyline, richness of the dystopian society, meticulous thought in all of the small details is all faultless. I genuinely feel like I am a part of what the characters are going through and this again is testament to the incredible acting. Cannot rate highly enough and am waiting with baited breath for season 5.",3,negative
"Just finished Andor Season 2 and it had me hooked from beginning to end. The pacing, the tone, the stakes...it all hits just right. And can we just talk about the decision to release multiple episodes at once? Amazing... It makes such a difference bingeing a few episodes in a row, it lets you get fully immersed without that frustrating wait between weeks. You're pulled in, and the show doesn't let go.  One of the things Andor does exceptionally well is embrace every core element that makes the Star Wars universe so rich. The politics. The war. The quiet tension behind closed doors. The chaos on the streets. It's all there. They've done an incredible job of showing how the Empire enforces its agenda and its suffocating control over people's lives and with that how resistance slowly builds.  Then there's the speech..Great... Even though it's coming from a fictional world, the message hit hard. It felt surprisingly relevant, like it was written for today, not a galaxy far far away.  But perhaps the most impressive part of all is how Season 2 pulls everything together. It all builds toward something bigger. Something meaningful. The story doesn't drift.... It connects. And by the end, you realize just how nicely crafted this journey has been.  Amazing show.. a real star wars master piece.",7,neutral
"The characters are obnoxious and cringey about their wealth and privilege but this was done in a good way. This comedy came with a great deal of self-awareness and depth. There was a considerable amount of work done in this very clever dark comedy.

"This plays like a 1950s John Wayne movie where the hero is the All-American boy next door, pure of heart and kills only bad guys! He is invincible, just an average guy, not a super hero in Spandex or with special powers. He saves damsels (and animals) in distress and has a heart of gold.  The plot for the series is a bit convoluted. The special effects are gory, but relevant to the plot. The action is fast paced and there are a few surprises. It is a very entertaining series that keeps viewers engaged. The best thing about it is the complete lack of ""Wokeness"" that is so pervasive in many of the current series.",4,negative
"The conclusion does not sit well with me. We have no idea what happened to the other villains or what will happen to them. I assumed that since this was Tommy's final act, everything would be resolved and he would have a proper finale and closure. I'm not sure how I feel about this because there is no new season. I only wish there was another season to wrap everything up and give it a good ending. There is gonna be a spin-off movie but it might not have Tommy in it! So I am not expecting anything. Overall, just a bit disappointed but the show is a solid 9/10 if not for the ending. ????",7,neutral
"David Carradine must roll over in his grave in Bangkok when he sees this series on DeadPrime. For everyone who was counting on a great second season, here is a painful Reacher that drags on without any awareness that it could be a memorable series. To support that upper body, a 1.90m man would need to eat like an ox, train for more than 3 hours, and have a stable life. A person who walks miles on foot and is homeless has no chance of having a body like that. Many ideas here show us that there should be any type of general schooling on writers and a culture test before doing this job: the concept doesn't fit with the various stereotypes attached to Reacher. It's not possible to get past the second episode, even if you like its character. The first season was intriguing, though.",10,positive
"What a great show, dark, funny and great story line. Lots of subtle nods and references to old school Adams family stories including actors/actresses from that era.  Great casting of Wednesday she played the emotionless yet dark character perfectly!  Hats off to the costume team as well for all characters new and familiar.  It would be nice to learn more about the school and the different types of teachers but try not to go too hogwarts though with Tim Burton at the helm I'm sure it won't  Well done netflix another binge worthy series I'd happily watch again....so when is season 2 coming?

"Peaky Blinders"" has received critical acclaim for its storytelling, performances, and production values. Fans of crime dramas, historical fiction, and character-driven narratives are likely to enjoy the series for its engaging plot and memorable character.. It's very much intriguing. The show's plot is filled with twists, turns, and political intrigue as the Shelby family navigates rival gangs, law enforcement, and internal power struggles. The storytelling keeps viewers on the edge of their seats and leaves them eager for more. It is known for its distinctive visual style, including the iconic flat caps worn by the Shelby gang members. The show's cinematography, music choices, and editing contribute to its unique and stylish aesthetic.",10,positive

"I watched this Wednesday, last night All of it and oh my god is so bad.  Mostly some copy/paste from various good movies and plots and styles, nothing interesting or original. The Addams family, Harry Potter, Sherlock Holmes and some intellectual Alan Poe farts.  Stupid and cheap.  CGI like in movies like Hercules and Xena.  What more can I say about the actors. CZ Jones is like a mummy brought to life who moves briefly so that the smudge on his face doesn't break or his damn head falls off his shoulders. I remember Angelica Houston in that role. How cool it was.  That plump and linear child that is Wednesday, hmm, I don't know what to say, but compared to Christina Ricci, she is absolutely zero.. with a muzzle.  Sorry Mr. Burton, unfortunately it is impossible not to compare, if Addams is copied 1 to 1 after Barry Sonnenfeld's film.  You somehow expect something more subtle, unusual, interesting if you hear Tim Burton's name, even if he is not a director but a producer.  It is not the case and I feel sorry for those youngster that didn't saw Sonnenfeld s Addams or older Burton s movies.",1,negative
"I was a big fan of Reacher during the first season. It was a different kind of action show. It was meant to be deep, meaningful, kind wherever possible and only invoke violence when absolutely necessary. The relationships were real and complex and the storyline interesting.  I noticed season 2 started becoming more 'typical action-y'... but still a complex, interesting storyline with deep relationship building from historical bonds.  Unfortunately, season 3 is a jump the shark all over the place. It's a real bummer to what I thought this show was about.  The ridiculousness that Reacher has a gun and uses it right away in the first episode goes against everything he stood for in the first season.  The unbelievable scenarios throughout when it comes to things like heavy security fences and cameras but only pointing at one entrance at the estate and none at the warehouses used for illegal activity?  The episode of remembrance of Reacher working with a young officer and then sending her and another rookie to take down some evil mastermind who, according to comments made at the beginning of the episode would have the utmost scary military security detail covering him, without proper back up?  Jumping the shark everywhere :(.  It's now become boring, typical and uninteresting. Frankly, showing Reacher with minimal clothing on is simply not interesting enough or worth it to keep watching :(  Bummed.",10,positive

And I have no regrets at all. This show was excellent! Like painfully perfect. To the point my family & I watch this show regularly just cuz.  And with every watch, I pick up another connection and secret message hidden in the show about this universe.  When I was an episode in, I called my relative and said damn you didn't tell me this was Tim Burton's show. It was too good for Netflix and I had to check who made it. Lo and Behold, my childhood favorite Tim Burton. I knew it looked, sounded, felt familiar. A unique style like Tim's with an immortal family = masterpiece.

I almost turned it off during the 1st one because nothing made sense at all but then the flashbacks kicked in during episode 2 and onward and it came together. I don't want to get into politics and religion, and its very easy to do with this show. I would categorize this series as horror (almost) due to the things that these handmaids are put through.

"Me and my girlfriend just tried this show because we heard it was amazing. And it is. However, we do laugh every time main characters run in to eachother in different cities and even countries. It's like the population of the whole continent of North America is only 400 people. What is also interesting is that I don't really see the (in flashbacks) liberal scenes of Luke and his friends as a utopia or greatest society. I don't want the main characters to possibly return to a society that's only like that. I kinda hope for a future (in this show) with some respect, no cursing all the time and no hipster clothing.

"Finally you get a great interpretation of the Star Wars series and you blow it. Making this politically one sided is not what your founder would have wanted. So tired of this up coming generation ruining TV, Movies, and this county. Freedom of speech is a swinging door, you have the right on both sides to voice your opinion and not be judged. I was so happy to get Disney+ and see all these films I love, and to have to cancel them hurts. But no one in this country should support an organization that supremes the constitutional right of free speech because it doesn't go direction of today's society. I no longer allow Disney in our home anymore, I can not support the parks, and I even advise others to follow and put an end to corrupt organization such as Disney. For the rest of the actors on the show I would like to say thank you and I hope you continue to make good programs but hopefully not with companies such as this one.",9,positive

I've played The Last of Us video games a few times so I'm familiar with the story and even though the show doesn't stick to the same script exactly as the game I couldn't care less. As long as a show is good, I don't care that's it's not exactly like a book or video game or whatever. I don't get why anyone would. It's very hard to adapt a book or game into a tv show or movie. They have to change things up that don't translate well or don't have the time to get as detailed as a book or game. My only complaint is that we have to wait 2 years between seasons.

You might think it's a little weird at first but it gets better as you watch and it also is pretty clean there is only a little bit of kissing and a few inappropriate words, but other than that it's fine. One of my favorite things about it is that there are mysteries and they might make you brain hurt but it's so fun.",10,positive
"The first season was very impressive and even made me forget about Tom Cruise ever playing Reacher.  Reacher was strong, powerful, a good fighter, demanded respect, was respectful even when resisting, all of which made him highly attractive.  In season 2 they seemed to have totally altered the original and well-known Reacher character though.  First of all there are his looks. The actor did so much work on muscle, likely took steroids, and no longer looks attractive. Too much of a good thing is still too much. He now looks off-putting which isn't congruent with how Reacher is supposed to be and look. He can't even move normally anymore, his muscles are in the way. In order to be effective, strong, and yet elegant in fighting you cannot be a gorilla or body-builder. You have to train different muscles for speed and strength.  Then his personality. He now acts like a blunt projectile without a brain and unfortunately his appearance matches that.  The respectful approach when taking on an opponent, or talking to an ally, has gone. It's like we're dealing with an entirely different character, both inside and out, no longer Reacher as we have gotten to know him.  What is also lacking is a person like Finlay and Roscoe. For some reason they glued everything together in season 1. The cast surrounding Reacher in this 2nd season doesn't have that same effect. Something about the whole setting is 'off'.  I'm not sure why this allowed this to happen. Another writer or producer maybe?  What I do know is that it's not an improvement. Season 1 I'd rate a 10, but season 2... a 4 rating is doing it a big favour.  For me this is enough. No need for a season 3 unless Reacher character goes back to looking normal, his character become normal ""Reacher"" gallant & powerful again, and of course a decent story as this 2nd one doesn't really work either.  Fan of season 1 Reacher, not of season 2.",10,positive

"You feel they borrowed a lot from Harry Potter and Scooby-Doo. It is quite obvious who the villain is from the moment her backstory is presented, and it's easy to identify her from her episodic presence and lack of negative attributes, so just like in Scooby-Doo.  The relations between characters is superficial and any negative attitudes just get lost in plot.  However for very young audiences you can see how these things are actually intriguing and Wednesday's semi-dark background is edgy and cool.  Also the way it directed, the nature shots, the creepy locations is all eye-candy.  I would have loved to see a bit more thriller/horror, as they barely show any blood and ridiculous wounds, while every single action is cut before you can see it happening. I guess they really wanted to be a family friendly show.",7,neutral
"What... the...???  I absolutely hate this incarnation of whatever this is trying to be.  I loved the original TV series and the 2 movies from the 90s, but since then it constantly seems to fail and this show is no different.  Poor Morticia is beautiful but married to a hideous filthy toothed crime of a man. Wednesday is... not delightfully weird, she's just abhorrent weird.

"This series puts Cruise's movies to shame - Alan Ritchson punching through a car window, yes; Tom Cruise, no. Perfect casting also applies all the way down the lineup of supporting characters. The flashbacks to Reachers childhood are exquisitely done, and the acting & direction overall are outstanding. The storyline is well presented, and features such despicably murderous bad guys that the justice meted out to them by the hero is cathartic. The dialog & pacing are crisp, leading to a thoroughly satisfying conclusion. The only thing I didnt like was that the crowbar beatdown Reacher got in one of the fight scenes was uncharacteristically out of place, Looking forward to season 2!",10,positive
"I love the game, they tell it in a different way and you just have to learn to separate the two. Because the show is REALLY good. I like how they're making it different from the game so people don't know exactly what to expect, sure casting could be an issue for some people but if you look at the characters and the way they're portrayed by all of the actors, each character is portrayed well. I wish Ellie was a little more angry, or some parts were a little more show rather than tell (like abby and her motive) but I understand why they did what they did.

"This is THE show anyone who grew up with classic Star Wars needs to see. 'Mature' Star Wars, if you will.  Maintains the aesthetics of Rogue One and has a quality of writing to shame recent pathetic efforts. Stands as a great little sci-fi adventure on its own, within the Star Wars universe.  Terrific production, script and depth of accomplished acting performances - tremendous - give it a gravitas to have you salivating if you ever so much as tingled at any great Star Wars movie.  One particular visual snippet as an example - S1E06 'The Eye' has Tie Fighter pilots scrambling into their machines. Mere seconds of screen time but a scintillating burst of realisation that such dynamic moments have never been 'authentically' presented to you before. Ally that with engaging and stimulating dialogue, and it delivers some great stuff.  Treat you inner kid and impress your critical adult: don't miss out on giving this quality production the attention and admiration it deserves. This is Rogue One (the 3rd greatest Star Wars movie behind IV & V) expanded. 8/10 and climbing.",7,neutral

I am not even going to comment on the issue of people comparing this to GOT ... That comparison is irrelevant for me. I have been waiting for this series for months and was not disappointed in the least. It isn't difficult to see that 2 timelines are in effect for the season meeting in the last episode... I personally love they way that was done so that we get to see everything leading up to the point of the season as well as the current timeline. Things will get going hard come the next season I think. This whole project was done incredibly well and I am looking forward to the continuation of the series! The acting and effects are spot on as well as the soundtrack and everything else! If you are a fan of the book series then definitely give it a chance and even if you are not familiar with the novels you can get into the show. This is one of those times when I really wish that the season was longer. Waiting for a year for season 2 is just too much! I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is interested in fantasy and mythological type stories.,9,positive
"This show has it all. There's deceit, lying, murder, cheating, all sorts of crazy antics like drinking and drug use and sex but what makes the show really get you going is the characters. These characters are really interesting and you get just enough backstory to know if you are going to love them or hate them. I really enjoyed how the different characters worked with each others storylines and I also liked how you didn't really ever know who was going to be killed. The real standouts in season one is the hotel manager and also the couple that was on their honeymoon. Jennifer Coolidge as Tanya was great as well especially in Season two. It's not everyone's cup of tea but it was a great show to binge in the new year.",9,positive

I could notice nothing original, nothing untold or not done in the whole season! There are many shows streaming now that are -I'm not exaggerating- at least twice as better than this show. What a disappointment and letdown!",1,negative
"TWL had something of a contemporary Agatha Christie. A sort of modern ""Ten Little Indians tales"" feel twice successfully refreshed by a change of cast and location. Season 1 was somehow conventional and mass but somehow contained enough satyre and subtlety to build up something interesting and hook the viewers. Season 2 was, imo, the best offering a refined version, a well-brought intrigue, great characters, and a beautiful scenery.  Season 3 is just a different show and has nothing of what made season 1 and 2 so remarkable. The humor is flat, the intrigue unfolds sp slowly and unsurprisingly it's painful, most characters and stories are dull and unnecessary. I feel bad for the cast that includes some great actors, and they do play well, but the material they were provided with is so subpar they won't succeed in creating any momentum. Plots are so loose, no matter what will happen in the next coming episodes it won't buy me back as watching the first half of the season required too much effort of trusting the writer(s) to surprise me and show something better the next week, and the next week, and the next week. In vain.  The White Lotus season 3 has absolutely nothing to tell, no mystery to unfold, it certainly doesn't take the viewers on the trip.",2,negative
"So, yes, it leans heavily on drama. No light sabers. Only a few action sequences, and they're not flashy.  The writing, acting, music and direction are pretty much the best the Star Wars movie/tv universe has ever offered, with only The New Hope achieving a more compelling and well-conceived narrative. I also rate Rogue One extremely highly, but the story here is more complicated, and told from more vantage points.  I enjoy Mandalorian, Ahsoka and Boba Fett but this is aiming for a different audience. There is no cute. There is no snarling at the camera or posing. The writing actually makes sense, it's thoughtful - no one-liners that sound good but then make you think ""huh?"". But there is also considerably less of a fantasy element. Few aliens. The droids are not very significant. I'm not sure anybody even says ""Jedi"". Less space theme in general.  This the closest thing there is to ""grown-up"" Star Wars - and it's phenomenal - I wish it were all of this quality. I would love to see more of this approach WITH all the fantasy and sci-fi elements intact.",10,positive
"Fabulous and can't wait for season 6. I have watched it twice now. The writing is great, lots of twists and turns. This is not a typical series with predictable plots. The sets are great with great costumes. And the acting......oh my, Tommy, Aunt Pol, Arthur...All are so entertaining and will keep you watching and wanting more.",9,positive

"First off, I want to say that this might be the new great zombie show. The Walking Dead just drags itself through the mud but man Last Of Us doesn't. Each episode is so addictive and you just want to see more of it. Play the game or not, Last Of Us is beautifully done. Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal both knock there roles out of the park over and over. They're acting feels so real but the dialog is written in a fun way. Nothing in the show is slow, it builds a compelling story and does so in a new way. How you get the virus in general is a really creepy, well done way to do a zombie virus show. Overall this is an incredible show. The only reason its not a 10/10 is because I want to wait until season 1 finishes before giving it any further rating.",10,positive
"Andor is just objectively great writing, direction, acting, cinematography, music, and wardrobe. This series builds characters, plot, and suspense at a steady pace that left me wanting to see the next episode immediately. This gritty and adult drama showing what life is like for the inhabitants of the Empire, and the events that led to the rebellion, is what I've always longed to see in the Star Wars universe. Simply superb. All involved should feel very proud of what they have done. My faith in Disney's management of Star Wars has been somewhat restored after some initial lacklustre efforts. More well written and acted stories like Andor is my hope for the future of Star Wars. Disney - please understand that those involved in the Andor series know and understand how to make a great Star Wars product. Allow them the weave their magic, support them, and you have a winner on your hands.  Update 2024: I was disappointed with the following series of Kenobi and Ahsoka, and I feel like crying (tears of frustration and disbelief), while watching the awful, awful, The Acolyte. Will Disney not learn? I've now cancelled my Disney+ subscription.",10,positive
"The first episode was so slow and boring. I still have no idea what the plot is other than the speculation that comes with being a sequel.  The whole Empire/Rebel thing has gotten stale now and they just copying stuff from the ww2 era for this series.  You know how most first episodes, even if they have a slow start, leave you with a cliffhanger that really makes you want to watch the next episode? Not here! I literally have two more episodes available to watch immediately and zero interest in watching them.  People calling this 'deep' and 'mature'....just lol. Long dialogues don't make a show deep and mature, altho this show tries hard to appear so.  Where's the aliens? Aliens are what make SW special, otherwise it's just a generic show in Space. I doubt anyone would remember this show 5 years later. Disney needs to move on from this Era already.",10,positive
"If you love the books you'll love this production.  Unlike the tiny Reacher played by Cruise, the Richson incarnation has the physical size and bearing of the book Jack Reacher. The scripted ""detail"" in the dialog matches the books' glorious detail of Reacher's deductive super-power (as written by Lee Child in the books) and the action scenes are choreographed as well as any block buster action flick.  Kudos to Richson for taking his already jacked body up a couple of notches to put on a massive amount of lean muscle...no easy task.  Prime would be crazy NOT to renew this show for at least 10 more of the books.",2,negative

"Brilliant TV adaptation of a lot of short stories from The last wish and Sword of Destiny books. The world building is great. Soundtrack is better than what I expected and shown in trailers. Fight choreography is insane and comparatively better than all of the tv series I have watched till date.  Henry Cavill is nailing the role of Geralt. I dont have good expectation from Yennefer but she is also giving her best to the role. also As this is only prologue to the main Witcher saga, We can expect a lot from further seasons. Only bad thing is that after binge-watching season 1 I feel empty as I know we have to wait till 2021 for season 2.  And remember don't trust critics reviews they know nothing about Witcher books and games especially The Witcher 3.See audience score it is currently at 93 % on rotten tomatoes. Thats all matters.  As I have played Witcher 3 I know how much potential this series have if done correctly. Can't wait for season 2.",10,positive
"So good to last to Season 4 Episode 10. I just wish this series could go on forever! Every actor in this Drama Series is well cast and performed so well.

The good, the bad and the ugly...the ethic, the morality, the relationship between and among them...Well, I just can't say how I much I appreciate them so far; my list is just endless. Keep it coming, guys. I'm holding my breath for Season 5 and counting the days.",9,positive
"As a long time fan of the books I was thrilled to watch the faithful adaptation that Season 1 was. Script, casting, action and plot, all first rate. I watched the whole season multiple times. It was that good. So what happened to Season 2?  The script, which is laughably bad, is not helped by the acting, which is appallingly wooden across the board. Even Alan Ritchson looks uncomfortable in his own skin. The action this time round is a jumble of frenetic jump cuts and quick pans, a sure sign that the actors you've hired can't manage a convincing fight scene.  And the plot, which is childishly straightforward, lacks any of the mystery or suspense of Season 1 or indeed the source material. Reacher is a lone wolf, who doesn't play well with others. Saddling him with three inept sidekicks who spend half their time belittling him and the other half on dull, domestic subplots masquerading as character development only end up making our hero play second fiddle in his own story.  Everyone involved with this debacle should rewatch Season 1 and do better next time.",9,positive
"Literally every single person in this show is unlikeable and there's not a single character in the entire cast to root for or identify with.  It's supposed to be a comedy but there's little evidence of that. It's supposed to be a drama but there are no stakes. All we're left with is some random horrible people who don't say anything funny, don't do anything impactful, and hang out by the beach.  I'd be fine with it if there were jokes or funny situations. I'd be fine with it if there was compelling drama. I'd even be fine with it if there was anyone to root for, feel for, or identify with, but there's none of that here.",5,neutral
"Season 1 of White Lotus is a great reminder of why digital streaming services beat out cable TV and why movie theaters are seeing more and more empty seats. The 7 episodes give the writers ample time to set up interesting relationships, the actors to build up their characters, and the director to implement tons of gorgeous shots and have greater control over the pacing.  This storytelling structure is what gave many character-focus TV shows their advantage, such as Midnight Mass, Daredevil, Severance, Succession, and so many others.  White Lotus Season 1 has a promising start, beautifully weaves in all kinds of interesting concepts and character dynamics, and ends on an incredibly satisfying note. All the characters are fun to watch for their own unique reasons, the B and C plots are as satisfying as the A plots, and the acting is superb.  Season 2, on the other hand, is a little weaker when compared to the first one. The plot is a little less down-to-Earth, as the characters are taken to more extremes. They're still entertaining, sure, but they just don't feel as nuanced or subtle as the ones from Season 1. In fact, one particular character becomes infuriating to watch, as they are completely blind-sided when things are clearly going very wrong. They come out as completely stupid and it feels like anyone with half a brain could see that something was very wrong.  Besides that, visually, Season 2 is also not as interesting. There are gorgeous vistas and some incredible shots, but they still don't have as much charm as Season 1. I think this more has to do with the fact that the cultural setting of Season 1 had a much greater hand in the story than the cultural setting of Season 2.  The ending of Season 1 wraps everything up perfectly, giving enough attention to all the plot points, so that nothing feels unfinished or hastily-concluded. Season 2, however, builds up quite a bit, only to really give a satisfying ending to just one major plot-point, sidelining the rest and making them feel a little unfinished. Like imagine a really attractive steak but it's still raw. Looks good, might taste OK, but it's still raw and needed a little more time in the oven.  All in all, a fantastic show and despite a weaker second season, I still believe it deserves a watch; binge even.",8,positive
"Wow. This is a wonderful little gem or a show. Very unexpected. It should get an 11/10 if it were possible. Wonderful witty writing, dark themes, fantastic acting and the everlasting unmistakable Burton world of sound and visuals.  Jenna Ortega has only come on my Radar from this show. To say she brings the character to life is a massive understatement. She nailed every line, every look with all the style of a Tim Burton character.  I cannot wait for Season Two and suspect I will watch this show another couple of time before that happens. I urge everybody to watch this. You will not be disappointed!",10,positive
"So I new about wednesday from the day it released and started showing in recomendation on netflix but I didn't want to watch it cause I thought it was just an another series with stupid magic tricks and stuff just like Boys, I didn't watch it. It just looks all stupid to me. My friends were watching this and told me that this is really a great show and I shouldl definately watch it, so I watched the first episode and it really is great. I really liked wednesday's acting in it and the way she behaves. She is so talented in many thing, like she does archery, she knows about plants, she dances, she rows, she has visions and still she likes to be alone.  I so relate to her and like her character so much.",10,positive
"This series is a high-quality blend of mystery, crime, and action. Overall, the plot and complexity are well-executed and engaging. The character dynamics, particularly Reacher's ability to extract excellent clues from fine details, are enjoyable and reminiscent of Sherlock. However, the last scenes before the final part and the ending scenes of the final part are disappointingly predictable compared to the rest of the show. Additionally, some of the visual effects are overly simplistic and fail to impress. Despite these shortcomings, there are no major coherence issues to detract from the overall experience. With improvements made to the predictable plot points and the visual effects, particularly the explosion scenes, this series could achieve a perfect 10/10 rating. The predictable parts make it feel more like a generic action series, and therefore my rating is 9/10.",3,negative

Season 2 is just embarrassing to watch. The over the top gun battles where hand guns beat automatic weapons everytime, the jumping settings and my personal favorite, the helicopter scene near the end where Reacher is holding onto a gurney with an adult strapped to it, who suddenly finds a way to escape , yes while dangling in the air.  The dialogue is stale and predictable and the attempted humor is childish..not lee childish.  Do not waste hours with season 2. Go read the book.",8,positive
"The first half of season two, I thought they fixed all the bad stuff from the first season. They did. But then, at the end, pure money. I'm wondering why this happened at all. The end was so far estranged from the books as well as the games I'm even wondering what the financial plan is here; you know you explicitly want authenticity right? THAT is a moneymaker, please keep that in mind.  This here, such a giant slap in the face with a dead fish; GoT season 9.  Bias story: my friend told me at the end of season 1: ""You know what's so great about the Witcher? It's got it's own, European vibe."" I agreed, so proud; now I'm just down there, down.",10,positive
"Absolutely loved this. Quirky, original, perceptive and real. A character study of small lives and the utter banality and boredom bred by privilege. These characters are the centre of their universe and have little regard for anyone or anything else. Some moments were hilarious, others touching, heartbreaking and thought provoking. It's so utterly of our time but the questions it raises are timeless. A masterpiece!",6,neutral
"What a slog those 8 episodes were to get through. I love the character of Wednesday and the Addams Family as a whole, especially as portrayed in the first two 90s films. But only the first half of the first episode of this series captures the spirit of Wednesday Addams for me. In those first 30 minutes Wednesday delivers such crisp, snappy, irreverent dialogue that I thought ""wow, this is amazing - I can't believe how good this is"", but it doesn't last. The character is played well by Ortega, but the writing quickly veers away from what makes her and the Addams' so cool and instead drives down a one way street filled with childish teen drama.  Eventually they even kind of give up trying to make Wednesday unusual - she starts wearing increasingly normal clothes, develops close friendships with a shockingly large number of classmates, becomes more emotional and... well, increasingly normal.  It becomes this bland mix of Harry Potter and the recent Sabrina reboot (with an extra dash of Netflix's politics for good measure); a supernatural teen drama show littered with forgettable side characters, clichéd child-like plot lines, a tedious love triangle (yes, really), and cheesy dialogue peppered with trite political slogans.  It's so far away from the quirky, kooky, irreverent, gothic, deadpan, macabre, sarcastic, ironic, and surprisingly well-functioning family unit we know and love that it's almost offensive. Instead we have a resentful Wednesday, a weirdly frosty and controlling Morticia, a corpulent Gomez who has zero chemistry with Morticia, an afterthought of a Pugsly, and an almost non-existent Lurch (he does look the part at least). Only Thing is really nailed - the new design of the hand is cool, and he's amusing, dutiful, and endearing as a character. Funny how there's more character in that chopped-off hand than almost all other characters besides Wednesday.  3/10 for the three highlights: Ortega's acting, Thing, and some funny one-liners from Wednesday (most of which happen in the first episode). Everything else should've been sent back to the drawing board.",4,negative

"Great start to a cut back more story oriented show where cgi is a filler instead of a main stay. However, continuity needs to keep the blaster riffle on the same shoulder! c'mon its basics of story boarding, plan the shot and path!

"I heard about it before but haven't watched movie or animated adaptations, mostly because I was never interested.  What actually picked my interested was the setting of the TV show and the whole mystery thriller approach (in a way I thought it's going to be more world building oriented)  Now here is the thing, I like the show for most part but towards the finale, everything felt like half measured and rushed to an ultimate disappointment final climax.  Why build all that tension and plot around supposed 'destined' nemesis, only to have it handled so poorly.  The second season really needs to address this. The show had a strong start and then mediocre attempts to keep you engaged, for me at the very least started everything to fell apart somewhere after the episode 6.  Now, there is a lot of promising material lay out for season 2and the character building and characters have not disappointed but this show is not all about that, it has overarching plot that needs to be handled better.  Another thing is the whole we have all this supernatural beings and casters, but we are not sure how to handle them, as in trying to keep everything mundane, while undeniably dance at the edge or magical.  It just doesn't work. Second, we need more context of the world around. Like, more about outcasts and normies, how exactly do they come to live together in some sort of neutral agreement and etc. More about Nevermore, the show totally missed the spot there.  I get it, majority watch this as plot around one of their favorite family members, that is makeshift Elena Sherlock, but seriously though it won't hold for long and the show needs more subsistence if it is to continue with more seasons (and it has potential, as far as producer's imagination goes really)  For me this was fun to watch for most part but it left conflicted and not so much engaged. At the end, i didn't really care about unsolved mysteries, it didn't grip me to hold my breath until the next season, for no other reason than how awful last two episodes were and how sloppy 'curtains are down' reveal wasn't handled (not to mention cliche)",10,positive

"Jack Reacher (Alan Ritchson), a former U. S. Army military policeman, now lives as a drifter carrying only his passport, cash, and a French military service medal. Upon his arrival in the rural town of Margrave, Georgia, Reacher is arrested for his suspected murder of a man found dead near an overpass. Boston born and Harvard educated Chief Detective Oscar Finlay (Malcolm Goodwin) is suspicious of Reacher while Officer Roscoe Conklin (Willa Fitzgerald) is more receptive of Reacher's presence in the town. When a banker named Paul Hubble (Marc Bendavid) confesses to the crime without any corroborating evidence Reacher becomes embroiled in a mystery which only raises more questions when it's revealed the man murdered under the overpass was in fact Reacher's estranged brother Joe.  Based on the Jack Reacher series of books by Lee Child, Reacher marks the latest attempt to mine the books for adaptation following the Tom Cruise led film franchise fizzling out with the divisive follow up Jack Reacher: Never Go Back. While I enjoyed the Tom Cruise films to a degree (even the second one wasn't terrible) it's undeniable Tom Cruise did not match the description Child created in the books. Now free of the constraints that come with feature films and given more breathing room with 8 episodes, Reacher is fun detective fiction that creates an engaging narrative and a likable protagonist played by Alan Ritchson.  Alan Ritchson is fantastic as Reacher as he plays the character as a man with a strong sense of justice. Reacher doesn't actively seek out trouble, but if it happens to find him he makes it clear that it will regret having sought him out. Ritchson gives the character a lot of humor with his laid back charisma leading to some genuinely humorous moments between the various baddies he encounters as well as in his alliances with Finlay and Roscoe. Malcolm Goodwin is a solid ally for Reacher as despite being a man of intellect and character, he's not above getting his hands (or his tweed suit) dirty in pursuit of ridding the town of corruption despite often being looked upon as an outsider. Willa Fitzgerald is really good as Roscoe who has great chemistry with Ritchson and despite being a love interest isn't overly sexualized and can hold her own against the villains. The show's mystery is engaging with Reacher and his allies tracking down leads throughout the town of Margrave with actors like Bruce McGill, Chris Webster, Willie C. Carpenter, Harvey Guillen, and Kristin Kreuk giving solid performances as the various characters Reacher and company come into contact with.  Reacher is terrific entertainment. Alan Ritchson is perfectly cast as the titular Jack Reacher and is surrounded by a solid supporting cast who make the mystery entertaining and thrilling. The show promises even further adventures for the character derived from the books and if they stay at the level of this season I can see this having legs.",10,positive
"I have been looking forward to this show ever since it was announced, especially when I heard that the great Tim Burton would be at the controls. Well, let me say to all of the Tim Burton and/or Addams Family fans out there (which are legion) that you are in for a treat. This show is funny, scary, mysterious, suspenseful, and - above all - incredibly entertaining. Yes, the stories are completely ridiculous and make very little sense, but you won't care because it's so much fun to watch. Most of all, though, the biggest credit for the greatness of this show has to go to the amazing Jenna Ortega as the titular Ice Queen. Her performance is easily Emmy-worthy.

Of course this show sheds some light off of how we should never allow anyone in society to be treated as lesser humans.",9,positive
"There is a troubling trend over the last few years, where TV shows in particular are becoming more and more disturbing, chilling and predictive.  Is this mere coincidence? I think not. As we have seen from the world we are now living in in 2020, an authoritarian world is just around the corner.  These shows in my opinion are telling us broadly what world awaits us all. Yet again rouge elements are at work, using Terrorism to take control of a world. A theme that is used over and over again.  This show as is a masterclass in writing, acting, casting, sound design and pacing.  I have nearly cried watching this on more than one occasion.  It combines the terror a of a WWII holocaust movie, blended with a 1984 style dread and paranoia. All in all this is not a world anyone would want to live in  Whilst I do really admire the quality of this show, why are we constantly getting force fed this stuff as entertainment?  Because they use TV and Film along with books to communicate to us about what they are planning for us all. And for this reason this show is a warning not entertainment.",7,neutral

"This show seems to have found the magic that The Walking Dead (TWD) had for seven straight seasons when it reached its peak viewership of 17 million viewers.  I'm amazed that the ""zombie"" genre can still attract a major audience. Since TWD debuted in 2010, there have been more than 15 zombie movies and series.  In shows like these, quality is everything. Here the acting, production values and most of the writing is pretty good. I've never played the game so I'm rating it purely on its own merits.  I think the big challenges for the series will be to keep the pacing brisk and stories moving forward (both of which plagued TWD as it aged). Are they ever going to reach their destination? Is it going to be what they were hoping? Will we ever see humanity being ""saved""? Will they move around the timeline or ""Last Of Us"" universe or game versions? Who knows what's planned but hopefully they'll see the challenges of TWD and do something different.  But for now, if you're into post-apocalyptic zombie adventures ... or even just good sci-fi adventure shows, this one's for you.",3,negative

Having watched ""Reacher"" Season 2, it pales in comparison to its first season. Season 1 was pretty captivating with a very interesting storyline that was both intriguing and complex. In contrast, Season 2 is a big letdown. The characters, once full of depth and development, now seem flat and unevolving.

In this series our hero is finally accurately portrayed with sparkle and gruffness that is downplayed just enough to make Reacher likable in spite of himself.  Unfortunately, the support casting is lackluster...either that or they're Canadian... I definitely can see that the budget would require production going north of the border but the production values are the prime victims of their savings. It's a darned shame really.  The writers have obviously worked diligently at reflecting Lee Child's ""Bad Luck and Trouble"" and I cannot wait for a majority of Mr. Child's series to come to the screen and to determine how accurately his words reflect what I see in my head.",9,positive
"After the Season 1 finale, had to come back here and upgrade my rating to a 10. What a fantastic show! Original and thought provoking. Very well done.",10,positive
"Damn, it is a drama and a little bit slowpaced for what i usually like. But it is a great show and i am falling in love with Kelly Reilly, she plays the black sheep of the family with top performance. Go watch it, it is not packed with a lot of action or suspense, but it is a good storytelling series with great character development along the way.",10,positive
What an amazing production. After watching a few episodes I was not surprised to see the vast list of nominations and awards they received or win. This TV series reached a new level in balancing tragedy and hope. They really found a great way to touch viewers hearts and keep us thrilled. I lost count of how many times I found myself in tears of joy and sadness. I can keep mentioning for hours all the reasons I consider this a great production. I really can't found a single way for improve it. It is simply superb!,9,positive
"Those positive reviews are clearly fake or done by internet trolls, because what have I been watching and can I get those hours back? Where is the storyline and who are all those characters? Character development clearly wasn't a priority and making the main character likeable has been forgotten. Many scenes don't add up, characters come and go with no information or background and the timeline is gone. And then there is that Squid Game thing which isn't Star Wars at all. This has to be one of the worst productions of Star Wars ever and one of the worst series in 2022. This isn't Star Wars. It's just some guy with a bad attitude. The few good things are the female leads and the overall message!",10,positive
"The story line seems a little all over the place at times, but at the same time I'm loving it. The pace of The Mandalorian is putting a fresh spin on Star Wars and keeping it relevant. I absolutely love whenever Bryce Dallas Howard is the director, she knows how to tie in the classic feel of Star Wars with a new generation, and exceeding demand for quality CGI. I love that this show has introduced new alien species and planets into the cinema Star Wars lore, yet manages to stay true to the characters and races of the extraterrestrials we know. Grogu is likeable, and all the actors put on quite a performance. I'm excited to see what more comes from this show, and what else Bryce Dallas Howard can do for the Star Wars franchise! Highly recommend watching this if you haven't yet!",10,positive
"The first half of the season captures the ""Addams Family"" vibe very well: dark humorous, and a little offbeat. The end is transformed into a stereotypical fantasy teen drama mixed with mystery-revelation-bigger mystery ""dance"" that progressively becomes so fast-paced and over the top that I stop caring who is involved in what and why.  Excellent play in the character of Wednesday though her parents fall a little flat and without much of the so-needed chemistry. The series has outstanding cinematography, nice special effects, soundtrack definitely on-point.  A huge disappointment (feels like a plothole) is how a certain ill-intentioned individual is so determined to fight a ""special"" group of people without realising he is just as ""special"" himself as his enemies.  These series definitely feel targeted to younger audiences.",10,positive
"Not a huge star wars fan, I liked the original trilogy, other than that it's not really my bag. Rogue one was awesome and then I heard of this show. By far my favorite star wars story ever. And who isn't a fan of Jon Faverau? Well done. Can't wait for Season 2!",10,positive
"I had a difficult time getting through the first episode of Season 1. Yes this series is a little slow, specially season 1 BUT I promise you this if you stick with it, it will grow on you, so much so that it may end up becoming one of your favorite shows on TV.  There are many things that are impressive about this show. The soundtrack, mixing etc, the camerawork, the direction, the locations and settings etc etc. I can go on and on but what is truly impressive is how they have constructed their characters.  Layer upon layer they keep revealing everything about them and what lies beneath.  Everyone will relate because even if we don't act on everything that goes on in our crazy brains, we do have at some point come across these crazy thoughts. Or so I think.",6,neutral
"In this series, you all know are getting a horror and upside down style. It's help us to find a different ideas. This series tell us and we can be different. We should be the way, we are us. Every person need a friend. We can do anything, just keep a thing in mind, don't hurt any good and innocent person. Wednesday seems to be like a bad person, from her speaking style and her dress. But apart from all this, she is still a good person. She doesn't had any great power, but she can beat anyone. She always judge any person according to his/her actions in past, present and future. In this movie, I got all this in fixed amount.",5,neutral
I can't hardly wait for the next season especially after the season 3 finally cliffhanger. I did not start watching this series almost until season 2 aired because at the time my cable provider did not offer the Paramount network channel. I purchased season one as soon as I saw Kevin Costner on the cover and devoured the season watched it twice. I mean let's face it Kevin Costner and westerns simply go together.,1,negative
"... I would have skipped this after E4 (the one with the extremely cheesy highschool dance)... The series has much promise, but dabbles WAY too much in teeny soap. Jenna kept me watching, she's got a ton of charisma in this role... BUT: then they take away all that by evolving her character from everything that makes her interesting to just another girl infatuated with the handsome artsy guy... who then hands her an Iphone for saving his life... that's bad on so many levels... This series could have set a counterpoint to mainstream, instead the protagonist falls in line. If there's a second season and it picks up where this one left us, I'm out...",8,positive

"That's what I like about it. Music is used to the fullest effect to create an atmosphere of absurdity (things happen, family members don't seem to know each other at all, there's constant intrusion) that feels unlike other shows. Along with that, the script is deceptively brilliant. Jennifer Coolidge is freaking brilliant. Just when you can't take her anymore, she says something smart or gentle that reveals a more complex character. The pacing is sometimes frustrating, but given the ambiance and plot lines, probably intentional. Casting is perfect, every single actor is spot on.",10,positive
"I really enjoyed the series, it's what I wanted to see and what I needed to see. The plot is not that original, you can guess what is going to happen pretty early in the show. But the execution is marvelous. Jenna Ortega is very convincing as Wednesday and the script and dialogues are very well written, very entertaining and witty. The cello and the dance are both very nice touches, like the cherry on the top. The supporting cast is also good and the side stories are not annoying despite the whole story happening in a high school. The funniest of all is that they managed to make out of all the characters, including the grownups, comic book characters. I hope for a second season and I hope it can become the new True blood as it has a lot of potential.",10,positive
"Not a big fan of Tim Burton but this is well worth watching. Hope there is a new season. The ""thing"" is one of the characters in the series that is admirable. Let that sink in. How does that happen? Very good story telling. The acting is superb. Basically a ""who done it"" series using an anti-hero's anti-hero star (Ortega) in the lead role. Gwendoline Christie was excellent as the matron of the school. I was initially attracted to ""Wednesday"" when I saw that Fred Armison was portraying Uncle Fester. Catherine Zeta Jones was also very good in her role as Mortician. Some good life lessons to be learned in following parents footsteps. Try to be yourself theme throughout.",8,positive

"Wednesday scores 8 bags of popcorn.  I went in with high expectations. I always like watching one of these crazy shows like Riverdale once every year. Unlike Riverdale, this show was actually very enjoyable.  The show has many twist and turns that will keep you guessing. It's a great ""whodunnit"" and in the end you find out who done it. If you're like me then you will be surprised.  Wednesday is a great character. Her look matched her attitude and her roommate is a good complement. The show balances the dark themes and teen drama with humor and mystery.  I watched nick at nite and tv land growing up but I don't think I really watched the Addams Family. I did go back and watch the movies from the 90's and they are just delightful. I also asked my mom if she liked the Addams Family when she was a kid and she said ""yeah"". I also asked my dad the same question and he said ""yeah"" too. They're not together anymore but they share the same opinion on this one.  Wednesday is a fun show and I'll probably watch a second season if it comes out.",1,negative
"Let's start with the good: the protagonist is a fanboy and he's a damn good actor. It's obvious that Geralt is an emotional role that speaks to him and he knows the character and how to portray him. The music is sublime. The discordant fiddles in the music really capture the raw nature of the world that's being portrayed. This might be based in folklore, but it's no fairytale - here be monsters, kings and peasants and all the violence that accompany them. The cinematography is what I least know about, but I find it to be exceptional.  The writing and the pacing is where it falls short. Herky jerky backwards and forwards through time, with no notice and integration between the periods. Too much is left unexplained to the uninitiated, those unfamiliar with the Witcher universe, which is a rich and engaging source of storytelling and entertainment. Quite frankly, I didn't recognize this portrayal of Ciri - it didn't feel like her at all and I have no idea what her manifestations of power were meant to signify, why they were important, or how they pertained to the overall plot.  I just hope they pull it together for the next seasons.",2,negative
I love it ......I watched the whole series in one day I hope there a season 2,9,positive
So far I've seen three chapters and I would actually rather pay to see the rest of the chapters at the cinema than Episode 9 when it's released in a couple of weeks. We already know what garbage Disney cocked up there - based upon episodes 7 and 8. The Mandalorian is fun and exciting with a true Star Wars feeling. No identity politics that I've noticed so far. Just plain good and simple goodness.,8,positive
"This show is garbage. People who like this crap are so weird. We kept waiting for some sort of plot point that would move the story along, but nope, it's just a show about petty problems, odd people, drunks and drug addicts, terrible relationships, immature mean girls.  It's not funny enough to be a comedy. There's not enough drama to move you emotionally. It's just a weird snapshot of dumb rich people at a hotel.  And now I have to fill this review with 140 more characters because IMBD is also dumb and won't allow people to give short, concise reviews, only bloated wordy paragraphs... almost there.",5,neutral
"The series goes on very nicely, the storyline has been kept apt and indisturbed. Need more series which shows rural US for Global audience.

"The Mandalorian is a fan service show, it's easy to tell because I'm one of them, and I can spot certain things others doesn't care or understand. I appreciate this very much.  Unfortunately this is the only great thing about the show.  Not having a conventional plot but instead relying on fillers to make the show isn't my piece of cake but I'm absolutely fine with it.  The issue is with the lazy writing here. Sometimes is utterly bad but mostly it lacks imagination. I'm not going deeper to avoid spoilers.  This is perfectly ilustrated when it comes to characters interaction. Feels like all others are resonating around Mando just because. They have no motivation, no ambition, no goals. It's just too artificial.  The action is a mix bag containing weird convinient coincidences with carefully planed execution.  All in all The Mandalorian is a half complete show.  While it was made by someone who does understand SW in the end it's not enough.",10,positive
"This show was very entertaining and I finished it all in one sitting today. I love a good story between humans, or normies as they are called in the series, and supernatural beings. The twists in this series are quite well hidden, but with just a little bit of foreshadowing that if you pay close enough attention you can discover the mystery before it is unveiled to you. I think the series did a really good job at taking these characters from face value to adding dimension and character flaws that they could grow from in their character development sequences. This was quite the watch and I am hoping season two will measure up.",10,positive

"Virtually impossible to single out one particular performance from this ensemble cast - Murray Bartlett (increasingly unhinged Resort Manager) and Jennifer Coolidge (permanently unhinged) are incredible - Natasha Rothwell, Steve Zahn, Connie Britton and most of the cast breathe life into Mike White's hilarious satire of contemporary consumerist society.  No spoilers as I won't ruin it for you (as there are a few quite novel and shocking scenes) - the build up to the dénouement is exquisitely delivered week after week.  A few of the minor characters were two dimensional (e.g. Olivia and Paula) and weren't sufficiently 'interesting' enough, although understandably included as devices for cultural commentary. I would've liked their screen time to have been used on richer character development elsewhere.  Format of the show promises future delight's as a new cast will appear in Season 2 at another luxury location.",3,negative
"The Handmaid's Tale is a TV series adaptation of Margaret Atwood's novel about a dystopian world in which religious fundamentalists have seized control of much of the United States and remade it into a totalitarian theocracy called Gilead. Season 1 stayed fairly true to the book and its careful attention to detail in creating a realistic if horrifying society and providing hints of how the country evolved to get to that point. However, in Season Two and especially in Season Three the coherence of plot and background is sacrificed in an effort to create emotional roller-coasters, tear-jerking melodramatic moments, gratuitously terrifying evils, and ever more hair-raising escapes. Many key events in Season 3 are highly implausible in context. It is not that they are fiction. It is that they don't make sense in the reality of Gilead as it has been portrayed and developed in previous episodes. 1. Within the context of the whole world of Gilead, there is no way June would be able to organize a flight and get 50+ children out. A. Gilead has an air force, radar, and air defenses. The plane would not be allowed to take off. If it did get aloft, it would be shot out the sky or forced down. B. There is only a single Eye on patrol at the airport. All these women pelt him with rocks and he doesn't immediately call for backup. No, he decides to go off into the woods to investigate, where of course he gets ambushed. In earlier episodes, every place you see is swarming with Eyes armed with submachine guns and armored vans and helicopters are all over the place. Now at a high security installation like an airport, they are strangely absent. C. All these children are going to the back of a house, but the Eyes only check the front. The Eyes for some reason do not look at the back of the house. They do not send helicopters or observers in the helicopters don't see what is going on behind the house or the group walking in the woods. You'd think with a few dogs and guys on horseback they could find a gaggle of kids, Handmaids, and Marthas in two minutes.. D. With all the Marthas and Handmaids involved, it is not plausible no one talks. In a previous episode, inadvertent snitching by a Handmaid leads to an execution. E. Can the Marthas really drug their families without anyone finding out? None of these people are reported as missing appointments. F. A large group of children is led to meet a group of strangers and marched through the woods and somehow none of them scream or cry or have a tantrum or run away or have to go to the bathroom? Anyone who has been a parent along on a field trip knows it doesn't work this way. 2. It is ludicrous that June can kill a Commander who is bigger and stronger than her in a straight-up fight. She has been given zero training in fighting and has not been working out or exercising. Suddenly she can take on this evil guy who has been built up into a super-villain. Really, the whole sequence after her first punch is totally implausible. 3. Fred is cunning and not naive, but suddenly he becomes super gullible and goes without guards to a spot near the border and then blindly follows a guy he doesn't know for miles over the border where he and Serena get caught. That is not the kind of guy Fred is. Fred is the kind of guy who would more likely have an Army of Eyes waiting to arrest and torture the man. Then he might give Serena a few lashes with the belt as he did previously when she exceeded his limits on her authority. 4. We are treated to sights of Handmaid's with mouth grills that prevent them from talking. This makes no sense in the context of Gilead. First it seems to be a practice started in one region of Gilead. Everything we know about Gilead says it is ruled from the the top down. Regions do not get to make up their own rules. Second, it is impractical and unhealtyy - who takes the grills off so the Handmaids can eat. Recall Handmaids are given the best food so they will be healthy and have healthy children. Finally, no Biblical injunction is given to justify the practice and we know in Gilead everything that is done must be legitimized by a Biblical or religious citation.  The overload of macabre scenes and death-defying escapes had me arguing with the TV. Gilead is nasty enough. Season Three goes too far. It is a nonsensical parody of the real Gilead of Season One. So you may enjoy it as you are alternately scared out of your wits by horrible monsters sand overjoyed by cliff-hanger saves of our favorites from the jaws of crocodiles. But past Season One, it is sheer pablum and melodrama. You get tortured last minute brief explanations but they don't make much sense. If you don't expect a coherent plot or ask too many questions, you will find watching this series can be an emotionally rewarding TV viewing experience.",9,positive
"Season 1,2,3 good but season 4/goes downhill fast. Story bad editing, many boring flat dream scenes, nonsensical wanting to leave then go back then lrave then go back is just ridiculous and getting silly and repetitive now. Season 4 so predictable. The acting in season 4 isn't as polished as seasons 1-3either.  Watching season 4 im losing interest already.",4,negative
"Murray Bartlett was such an incredible surprise for me. I haven't seen much of his work but he was wonderful to watch.. He was definitely my favorite character.  As for the rest of the show it honestly relates to anyone who's worked in the service industry, had toxic relationships, hellish family vacations, or even vacationed alone.  Mike White managed to capture an incredible amount of depth within a wide range of characters in just six episodes and everything paid off. The cinematography, the music, the lighting, again the performances, well worth the watch.",9,positive
"Wow!  I am truly blown away with this series. I was extremely hesitant to start it at first, but once I started, I couldn't stop. Every episode more interesting and intense than the last. Let's start with the flawless acting. Perfectly casted Jenna Ortega took this role and RAN WITH IT. I forgot it was her on tv and not Wednesday Addams. I can't and will never be able to explain what a phenomenal job she did. I loved the incorporation of Christina Ricci, the original Wednesday, and how she was very active throughout every episode. I loved how multiple pieces would come together with each scene that passed. Every actor in this series nailed their role and it felt so real when I watched. Now, the dialogue...INCREDIBLE. Very unique and totally fitting to a series like this one. Fell in love with so many characters and their stories. Finally, the location. Gosh, Romania is gorgeous, and I loved how the creators of the show didn't stray away from the setting that Wednesday would be located in. I won't spoil anything, but I will say this..the show never lost its spark. Ever. *snap* *snap*!",8,positive
"I don't believe anyone does western films better than Kevin Costner and with Taylor Sheridan writing it is a win win for viewers. Take a look at ""Wind River"" for an example of what Taylor Sheridan can do. Where has Cole Hauser been hiding? He is amazing.

"I can only assume that Reacher was originally written as an imposing giant and physical specimen, the former being the most noticeably absent with McQuarrie's Tom Cruise entry. So Ritchson definitely looks the part. And we're reminded of it by a slew of height jokes, some welcome levity with a slightly wooden lead actor and a standard story.  Reacher, an ex-military drifter strolls into a small town and immediately arouses the suspicion of the locals and the fuzz. If it sounds like Rambo, yeah. But imagine Rambo as a quiet observer, astute, keenly aware, and intelligent-like Sherlock Holmes. But perhaps he's too smart for his own good as trouble seems to seek him out despite his logical prowess.  I was torn whether or not to root for Reacher because one could argue he's an antagonist, a ruthless killer who fights dirtier than any of his foes. His mastery of psychological guerrilla warfare turns the tides in his favor when he's outnumbered or outgunned. While he usually has reasons to regulate the bad guys, sometimes he does so impulsively.  Moral ambiguity aside, Reacher has some remarkable action sequences and ties in mystery with some romance and drama. The characters are well written and the story doesn't meander too much to pad the length. It feels satisfying to watch a tactless Reacher march into injustice and correct it with his fists. But maybe that says more about me.",10,positive
"This is one of my favorite series. You should watch 1883, also. They are connected, but not necessary to see both to understand. There is a lot of cursing, but you learn to get past it.

"If feel good movies are too much on the good side of fiction then this is definitely too much on the dark side - a little less and perhaps it could even feel realistic.

"Mike White's approach to a resort populated by the immensely wealthy and powerful is both nuanced, cringey and deep with pathos. While I never truly ""feel"" for the plights of these characters, the inherent tragedy of their lack of self-awareness makes for an interesting watch. Not to mention the almost existential pain of seeing them go on their merry way, leaving emotional devastation in their wake. Worth watching, if only to make you re-evaluate your life -- and to pretend like you are on vacation.",6,neutral
"I'm amazed at how good the reviews are for this show.  It's full of awkward cringey scenes, so-so writing, and a completely unoriginal plotline. Ortega is great as Wednesday, but that's about all that I have to say that is good about the show.  The romance between Morticia and Gomez is strained to say the least. With a truly strange choice in using Luiz Guzman. Anyone familiar with the Addams family universe will likely be disappointed and puzzled at this pairing.  The plotline itself is little more than Tim Burton's take on Harry Potter. A school of outcasts. How mindnumbingly boring.  The acting and directing is overly campy and awkward. The show can't decide if it's taking itself seriously or not, oscillating back and forth between drama and pseudo-drama.  Overall it's a good time waster if you have nothing better to watch. But I found myself mostly bored with the show, with occasional moments of vicarious embarrassment for the people involved in making it.",1,negative
"This is, minute for minute, some of the best television on today. Not a ton of FX. Just a compelling story and great acting. It is certainly more adult than other CGI laden spin offs. I don't think any cute cuddly toys will emerge from the series. But the story shines.  The plight of the rebels feels real. We're drawn into the characters one by one. The acting is first class. The writing succinct. And the ever enigmatic Andor keeps the tension taught and mysterious.  Though the series seemed in no hurry to gain traction, it's totally forgivable as we approach mid season. We're drawn to the next episode as we anticipate the the rage sure to be drawn by the empire.  The writers seem merciless with the characters and Andor himself has a sharp unscrupulous edge not quite on display in Rogue One.  Big thumbs up.",9,positive
"Just finished watching the complete seasons 1-6 having missed it first time around. This has captivated me from season one to the finale of season 6. I just couldn't stop watching it. It feels like it's been quite an epic journey, with a fitting conclusion. I had some initial reservations about watching this because it looked too violent. Yes, it's violent in places, but it's part of what makes the story and it doesn't deter from a well crafted series in every respect. There are plenty of twists, turns and unexpected events to keep you on your toes. It's a visual treat with a great soundtrack. The actors are perfectly cast and provide superb performances, especially from Cillian Murphy who never fails to deliver. Paul Anderson and Tom Hardy give us some very memorable characters too. The set design, costumes and special effects are faultless. I can only congratulate the broadcasting team who brought this to our screens. I've no doubt this will become an all time 'classic'.",10,positive

"I was 13 in 2013 when I watched PewDiePie play this whole game. And even then I was marveling at how well it was made, written, voice acted, etc. And now it being nearly 10 years later, I expected your run of the mill video game adaptation. This was not the case at all. Usually when you go into these things, you're expecting a lot of change with lore and source material etc. I was truly amazed with how much it stayed faithful to the original game. You could say it is just a copy of the 2013 game which won over 200 game of the year awards. But it's really not. It simultaneously manages to be its own while leaving in just the right amount of callbacks in. Yes, even with the cinematography there's tributes and almost shot-for-shot recreations. But I don't think this show will ever defecit from that. Only benefit. And it will only go up from here. If you're looking for a good post-apocalyptic show to watch, and you're not a fan of the original material, watch it. If you're a fan of the game and you're wanting to see it done justice, watch it. Watch this show. Regardless. You will not regret it.",10,positive

"I've only watched season three but I don't have any desire to watch any others. The reason is I have no desire to watch a show about characters I would cross the street to avoid. I don't understand making unlikeable characters with few to no redeemable qualities the focus of the show. The last episode of season three did it for me. The situation was way too contrived for the climax and so clumsily done and character logic made no sense at times. With a little finesse, the climax could've been a lot better. The climax also showed the least offensive characters became the worst. And what was that wrap-up? Some storylines weren't resolved and some characters walked away from carnage like it was nothing. I don't know if this show was to illustrate that people are just scumbags, because if it was, mission accomplished.  HBO does need to something about its shows from the last few years. Way too many center on miserable and unlikeable characters. Character depth isn't measured by how much of dick a character can be.",4,negative
"The first time I have seen peaky blinders was on youtube, there was a nice trailer with Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy. I like both actors and the accents in the show sounded cool, so I thought I will give the show a try and watched it to the end on Netflix.  Season 2 and 4 are my two favorite seasons of the series. If you like gangster or mafia stuff then this series is definitely something for you, but keep in mind the series is brutal and there is a lot of gore.  Now the bad thing and why I only gave a 7, the issue for me with the series was that there were too many scenes were just nothing happened and people were just talking and talking, I got a bit bored sometimes. But this doesn't mean it was a bad show though I still enjoyed it, the story is pretty solid and cool and I loved Tommy's plans.  Here is a funny fact about the series, Cillian Murphy who played Tommy Shelby smoked about 3000 herbal cigarettes in total during the first and second season.",8,positive
"Y'all really shot yourselves in the foot by firing and now proceeding to smear the very single individual that uplifted your show and garnered such massive admiration for it.  It's pathetic how Hollywood consistently takes a dump on a industry that makes MORE than it does as a whole, and vilifies anyone passionate or associated with it any capacity. These show runners and actresses sound less motivated to make top notch art, and more motivated by their warped perception of social justice.  Cavill is a lore nerd that plays video games for the storytelling.  Will not be watching s3 with this decision.",9,positive
"The show is Really Good they really hit the nail on the head with this one the acting, the story, the character development, Its all there! But its still far from perfect.... my main issue being that at times the show can be unserious and... Kind of Cringe if I'm being honest I really hope the up the fear factor for Season 2 I see people compare the show to Stranger Things which is kind of stupid (I mean ST has been out for almost a decade while Wednesday has been out for three years it hasn't had time to shine yet) Great Show! Its just slow if you can power through your gonna have a fun time!",10,positive
"Yellowstone desperately wants to be more than it is, but it has all the trappings of a soap opera.  However, Yellowstone lacks the depth or character development that even a soap opera has. Most characters are flatter than a Wichita pancake. The characters who aren't pancake flat are invariably homicidal -- yet they flit through life without consequence until a minor inconvenience happens that takes 30 minutes of plot time to resolve.  They were going for The Sopranos meets Bonanza. What they got was General Hospital meets Young Guns II. It's just not very good.",10,positive
"I went into watching The White Lotus not really knowing what to expect. I just finished the second season and now know why it's had so many great reviews and won so many awards. What makes this show so good is the acting and the writing. Each character is beautifully written and acted, not a weak link on either season. HBO always puts out great content and this is no different. It's not a show for everyone but I definitely enjoyed it. It's one of the rare anthology shows where both seasons are equally as good. I'm now looking forward to future seasons of The White Lotus and hope they stay as good as these first two.",8,positive
"What could be wrong about a guy who has no job, no permanent address, no possessions, who everyone in the military has heard the mthology of, loves and carries out any request he asks, even from cold phone calls?  Reacher, a guy who never makes mistakes, who has a perfect sense of morality and patriotism, and goes around killing people in cold blood, after the plot sets them up satisfactorily as bad guys who need to die.  I liked the Reacher movies with Tom Cruise, even though I would not say I am a Cruise fans, but the Reacher series is entertaining, it just rubs me the wrong way in that the character is ridiculous, and the plots are just excuses for very rough scenes of violence.  Additionally, at least in my opinion the seasons have gotten progressively worse and more gratuitous as they go.  Finally, it is like a comic book or video game. I watched an episode of S3 and the blocking and dialog was exactly like a video game, and even Reacher himself, looked like he was computer generated.  Watch for entertainment if you like this kind of stuff, but for me, nothing here, here. 3/10.",10,positive
"Her character is unnecessary and just slows down the story every time she is on screen.  I think within all 5 seasons, she has only shown one single depth of the same emotion.  She's not even Native American.  Poor choice to have her character created. Or they could have at least in maybe five episodes total across all the seasons to still achieve the same outcome.  Season 5 as a whole is super slow though, so there might be an underlying issue there.  Beth is getting to be annoying as well. Just focus on Jamie and John and the battle between them and sprinkle in some of the cowboys.  Jamie has gone super soft also, his character could of been a total b.a.",10,positive
Excellent casting and a huge step up from the Tom Cruise movie. Really good story and highly recommend. Great action and really solid story. Hope there's a series 2!,10,positive
"Its entertaining and has harry potter vibes, frankly entertaining, but there is still the odd comment and action by wednesday that feels out of place and more to do with current stances on this, now it's not overly in your face, but really, can you just entertain me and not lecture, since whoever still doesnt know how to conduct themselves in 'modern' social media world, isnt going to care and perhaps needs reminding, the general viewer who does care about how to treat people already knows how to treat people.  Apart from what I've 'splaned' the first few episodes were really interesting and the the vibe, but it's moving more and more towards something else - only three episodes in so maybe the score will get higher.  Kudos to the team :)",10,positive
"Although a slow start the series soo far has been nothing short of spectacular. I loved every minute of it and wish I watched it sooner. The soundtrack, the combat, the storyline all superb.

"White Lotus may be set in a luxurious tropical resort, but don't let the stunning backdrop fool you - this show is a scathing indictment of rich people and their entitlement.  The show follows a group of guests staying at a luxury resort called the White Lotus. There's the obnoxious newlyweds who can't stop fighting, the wealthy family with a troubled daughter, and the single woman on a spiritual journey (who may or may not be high the entire time).  But the real star of the show is the hotel staff. And let's not forget about the staff, who are expected to cater to the guests' every whim, no matter how ridiculous or demeaning. Whether it's performing a hula dance on command, or pretending to care about a guest's boring life story, the employees of the White Lotus are treated like human props.  But despite all the humor, ""White Lotus"" is also a surprisingly poignant examination of human nature. As the guests grapple with their own personal demons, and the staff navigate their own challenges, the show asks important questions about what it means to be happy, and whether or not money can truly buy it.  So, if you're looking for a show that will make you laugh, make you think, and make you want to book a vacation ASAP, ""White Lotus"" is the perfect choice. Just be prepared for a wild ride!",9,positive
"Seasons 1-2: 8 stars Season 3: 4 stars  Seasons 1-2 were surprisingly good. I'd played one game (the third) and read one book (the first), and wasn't expecting The Witcher to live up to either. I even thought Cavill would turn out to be a bad choice. But, I was thoroughly impressed by the series on every respect - and Cavill especially so.  The mini-stories, overarching plot, characters, monsters, setting, abilities, politics, etc, were in line with both the book and game, while also adapted properly into an addictive show. Almost all acting was solid. Special effects were mostly worked in naturally, and integrated into combat in ways that made it feel even more like the game. Characters were developed over time. And the direction did it all justice.  If you can decide in advance to watch just the first 2 seasons, and never worry about what might happen in the end - do it.  Unfortunately, season 3 is a complete dud that feels like an entirely different show altogether. It's more like generic fantasy series that just happens to borrow from the Witcher here and there. Direction is amateurish. Actors struggle to perform well, as the dialogue has become bland and/or stereotypical. Witcher-style mini-stories have been replaced with hedonistic, artsy parties, romance, and characters constantly staring at each other with sexual intensity. It's like some kind of daytime soap-opera, except modern and woke, and there's an occasional monster fight.  Worst of all, when the overarching plot does start to take hold, it's full of random, out-of-character changes. Since character development was set aside for love scenes, there was never any chance learn that characters were conflicted, gradually convinced of an alternate view, secretly a spy, etc. Instead, just 'bam, now I'm on your team / on the other team - yay/boo'.  It's not like the classic 'the first season is always the best', either. It's such an extreme difference with season 3 that it really doesn't feel like the same show at all. So very disappointing.  If you can't stop after just 2 seasons, I'd recommend it watching it at all. It really is that bad.",10,positive
"Cillian Murphy and Sam Neill are Amazing. I started watching the series because I saw that Sam Neill was in it, and that other guy who had a bit part in the Batman movies. As I watched the series I found myself extremely impressed with Cillian Murphy's acting. That was one of my first thoughts. As I watched on, I realized that the entire cast was great. The writing, character development, the acting, the soundtrack, the camera work.... the grittiness of it all. Usually a series takes a show or two, or even the entire first season to pull itself together into something great, this show started of spectacularly and rips right through the gate!",9,positive
"A bunch of unpleasant dysfunctional people go to a high end resort run by morons. You just want to slap everyone. Not even any humor. The son sleeps in the kitchen cause they didn't get a suite for daughters and son. Stupid right off.  There isn't a single person to like in this entire series. You hope there is at least group to like, even if they are awful and/or funny. Instead, we get an entire cast of people you wouldn't want to be caught dead with, let alone a series. And almost nothing really happens.  We forgot about this show until Kelly Ripa was saying how much she enjoyed it so we gave it go. Truly awful.  There isn't a single memorable scene or bit of dialogue in the first season. Not one. Every single character is stupid, boring, and pointless. If I had to listen to the guy complaining about not getting the room he paid for one more time I'd puke. So I just fast-forwarded.  There wasn't a word of clever dialogue and nothing that even approached humor. It's just a bunch of miserable souls being miserable.",10,positive

"Like Reacher I will be quick and efficient. This is a great series, true to the book, great cast, amazing locations and well worth your time. As a big fan of the books it was amazing to watch it literally come to life before my eyes. Look out for the Lee Child cameo too.",9,positive
"Finally, some great Star Wars content! Tense and suspenseful, this show is written for adults by adults who understand what a real story is. There isn't any nonsense, everything happens for a reason in this show. There's no ridiculous chase scenes (there are chase scenes, but they are well done), no lore-breaking tripe, and no bad acting. Everyone is great in their role. There is a lot of setup for the action that happens. Patience is a virtue because the payoff is incredible. The only gripe I have is there aren't enough little clues that this is a Star War. Droids and aliens are few and far between, but it could be explained away by things the Empire is doing in the show.",10,positive
"I still need to watch s6 of the peaky blinders but i've heard it sucked ;/ well so far i still enjoyed watching it, the storyline, the acting and the character development is splendid. Some episodes could be rather dull/boring but this tv show is just amazing!  .  ...",2,negative
"The source material, by Atwood, was a mere 300 pages. The first season of this show was a brilliant adaptation of her work. The continuation into seasons 2 and 3 feels forced. Similar to GOT, when the source material runs out the plot grinds to a halt and the show becomes unidimensional and repetitive. If I have to endure another longing stare of scorn and disgust from Elizabeth Moss I might just gouge my eyes out. Although the political undertones of the show may appear to be on the surface relatable, the show fails to explain the giant leaps in logic and relies too heavily on the rhetoric that the religious right is trying to drag us back to the Middle Ages. The men of Giliad are basically straw men with not a hint of moral complexity. We get it. The ""patriarchy"" is evil and women have been victims up until about 60 years ago. This show is about as depressing as my Facebook newsfeed during election season. I think this should've been a one and done mini-series.",9,positive
Ok so i gave it another shot and liked it a whole lot better. I think they improved the video quality.  My complaints are the timeline makes no sense...and the whole world seems to be set on the witcher marrying a little girl.... If thats not the case it sure sounds like it. A child surprise sounds like a deeply perverted porn fantasy and everytime they said it I thought they wanted to prostitute children.,10,positive
"I hate to even say this, but I liked this show very much. It was well done and amusing. Fully expected to hate it, this is NOT something I would normally watch. This is teen TV. I tried one episode out of sheer boredom and got hooked - binged the whole thing, and it was fantastic. Jen Ortega is absolutely delicious, very cute and very funny, charming captivating little beauty. The story Tim Burton rolls along just at a fine pace, by a Master Director. I enjoyed every moment. Jen Ortega's dance sequence is a thing of beauty, but the story is just fine by itself. You will enjoy this series even if you think it's aimed at a teen audience.",9,positive
I saw several critical reviews about The Witcher before I watched as I had my own reservations. When reading the reviews most of the negative reviews make it obviously clear the critic has never read or interacted with either the source novels/short stories or the popular game series. This series captures the themes of the story in a way I had frankly thought impossible to do on tv or film. I hope they continue this series for a long time.,10,positive
"I truly could not get into this series and I really persevered. The fighting was non-stop, gratuitous brutality; sex scenes in between; and the accents alternated between Scouse, Irish and Yorkshire. I couldn't follow the plot as it seemed to go nowhere. Every tentacle just seemed to end up in murders or sex. Helen McCrory was a very bad choice for Poll. She just sounded like a Scouse fishwife. I felt it showed the Gypsy community in Birmingham very badly. I know gypsy families there, who've made their way honestly for generations. And there wasn't a single likeable character. Yes, Cillian Murphy is easy on the eye - but Thomas Shelby is a hateful man. The few decent actors who managed their accents came from Sam Neill (born in N Ireland!), Charlotte Riley (from Co Durham!!) - and the actual Birmingham residents who auditioned for small roles when there were so many negative comments about the protagonists! Horrible show. And the soundtrack was bloody miserable.",10,positive

"I am not the person to write the reviews which in itself says how awesome this season is. When adapting any previously released material, biggest mess up that happens is in understanding and recreating the setting and the world. Being a big fan of witcher games, I can confidently say that this series captures the essence of the environment and its characters perfectly. Henry Cavill is pure awesome as Geralt. Same goes for Anya Chalotra as Yennefer and Freya Allen. I love that they had a story arch themselves making them much more important in the series. Action is fantastic especially the 1st episode nicely setting up the expectation and the meaning of a Witcher. I like the pick of the story for the series as well as it has been mentioned the games but never shown properly. So, this nicely ties the series with games. Really excited for the season 2....",1,negative

"After reading reviews with ratings of 1, Let me see what I am missing. At first this movie series was somewhat confusing to follow. I had to back track several times to get a good idea of what is going on. I saw hoe difficult it would be to follow the ""game"" concept, but it tried so hard to stick to the context of the story. Some say that this is a cheap imitation of Game of Thrones... I don't think so. But as I watched the series I begin to understand that I needed to have played the games on Witcher 1, and Witcher 2. I only became familiar with the game ""Game of the Year Edition""... And while playing the game, I never really bothered reading the books found in the games, or I just read some that pertains to the game, but missed on the story entirely. I might revisit that. The only negative I found is that Season 2 is not coming soon enough. Might have to wait a year for the release of Season 2, and I think Netflix dropped the ball. Because of the length of time of the next release for season 2, there might not be an audience for season 2. Hopefully the would not wait to release the entire season, but release each episode per week or something, while creating Season 3.... It can be done. Making different stories.... Maybe other Witchers adventuring other parts of the world, and coming together at the finale of the season, whenever that may be. I think the story telling is great, acting is great, and special effects is not cheap at all.",6,neutral
Season 1 of Reacher was perfect. Season 2 not quite as good. Season 3 really awful. A mess frankly. It's a lot about the book choice. Bad Luck and Trouble wasn't one of Child's best. At least in the book Quinn was a superb bad guy - in the Season 3 he's deeply unimpressive. And the whole thing of having Reacher 'undercover' in the house where the boss is just an underling of Quinn zzzzz - it's just not one of Child's best and this telling simply wanders all over the place. Desperately need to have the exact same writers/directors etc from Season 1 and a book that has the purity and linear simplicity of Book 1. Reacher/Ritson is a superb compelling character - that's why I still award an overall 8. PLEASE make sure Tripwire is the next book you do.,10,positive
"I went into this one cold out of nostalgia for both the original Addams Family show and the movie.  Episode 1 however set my expectations. This is not even adjacent to that one let alone a spin off, sure some of the characters share the name and aesthetic but that's about it. It's a show for grade schoolers only packaged in a dark aesthetic. Think the new Sabrina mixed in with Riverdale.  Jenna Ortega (as Wednesday) was amazing and the saving grace of this show. She killed it every second she was on screen, most of the humor worked because of her delivery.  The costume and set designs were also striking... but then you have the actual plot and writing.  The character development is nada. The world building is so simplified that it's down right childish. Some of the lines were good but that was only because of Jenna Ortega delivery, more often than not the show dipped into cheesy and cringe territory. The CGI monster... was something else.  Overall this show is a 4/10, it gets two extra stars for the acting alone but that's about it.",6,neutral
"I adore the movies from the 90s, so I was absolutely wishing and hoping this show will bring back the charm, comedy and eccentricities of the Addams', considering Burton is directing this one. Boy was I wrong. This hits all the wrong spots to the point where it's just not the Addams family.  The whole premise revolved around the clash of this unique family with normal vanilla society. So we get mermaids and werewolves? What? This literally makes Wednesday lose what was special about her, because she's actually the most ordinary one in the bunch. She's just a goth girl with mediocre teenage angst and the rest is every high-school show you've ever seen.  Remember her going to camp? That was classic. This is what I was expecting. What I got was just a teenager going to school Scooby-Doo mystery with none of the ingredients that made this family magical.  I'm not even going to get into the casting of the parents, each a disgrace to their former counterpart's brilliant and charismatic performance. They could have just put a black dress on a tree and call it a day. Below zero chemistry.  Then you have this horrible relationship between Wednesday and literally everyone. They used to have such amazing family dynamics. It was the perfect contrast to their absolute horridness that we all loved.  Where's the dark comedy? Where's the craziness of this twisted family while presenting it completely normal? I gave it 3 stars purely because of production value, but content is zero for me. Bored out of my mind.  #justiceforwednesday.",3,negative
"I completed the first season on a binge watch over the course of two days. The last series I did that with was with the first two seasons of Dexter. This series is almost as good but without all the blood and guts of that drama.  Hawaii provides a spectacular backdrop for the story of wealthy people vacationing at a luxurious resort run by a guy who reminded me of Basil(John Cleese) of the great TV comedy Fawlty Towers. He must bow to the whims of a cast of spoiled, self indulgent guests who have no empathy for anyone but themselves.  The cast is awesome and the scripts filled with a biting satire rarely found in today's shows.  The music is also perfect but be forewarned of some cringeworthy moments along the way.  The second season was even better than the first as we get a new cast with only two actors returning from the first season. The plot is again a wild one and the less said, the better in order not to spoil the show.  A third season is planned and I will be there for it. Take the ride.",8,positive
"The best character was Belinda, since she really was talented, and had to actually work for a living. And I do give credit to Tanya's character, as she certainly had a messed up childhood with two parents who were really messed up, as she was trying for closure. While the series, and I am only rating Season 1, was well crafted, it really is difficult to care about most of them. Wealthy and privileged and entitled, it is a soap opera which really isn't that interesting. Spoiled children who were dragged along, a man on his honeymoon who will not let go when a mistake was made. And really a man-child, whose new wife found out what she got herself into, with deep regrets. Are there some memorable characters? Yes, but one can quickly move on. The Season 1 will appeal mainly to those who follow 'reality' shows on television, as this really is a polished show of that kind. I am thankful it was only six episodes, so I didn't waste more time watching it. I am rating it based on how well it was done, not what I think it really should get rated for the people it presented.",1,negative
I love Tom but he ruined the movies. This TV series is PERFECT! THANK YOU!!!!  Please renew it for 10 seasons.  Yes this series is only in its infancy but it has so much potential. GREAT casting for reacher and the crew.,8,positive
"All the characters are well acted and the stories are fast paced and engaging.  Costner is excellent as are all the main part actors.  It's completely unrealistic however, with terrible atrocities and revenge attacks in almost every episode. Corporations involved in really violent criminality and none getting arrested by real police. Remedies are violent and excessive, therefore unrealistic.  Despite this, it is entertaining and encourages you to keep watching.  I'd prefer it if Beth was a little nicer at times. It seems overlooked that the main characters are complicit in wrong doing , yet we are made to empathise with their plight.",8,positive

"I'm not here to comment on the relationship to the video game this show is adapted from, I don't play games like that and don't know or care anything about them. From a purely cinematic point of view, this show is excellent thru the three episodes I have seen so far. Art direction and set decoration is superb, as is cinematography. Performances range from adequate to damn good. Writing is topnotch, I was not expecting much from a show with this one's premise -- I don't even bother watching any of the ""Walking Dead"" shows for that reason -- but the way in which they introduced the storyline, the various backstories, the human consequences and endurance of catastrophe, are all very well constructed and detailed, dialog is appropriately sparse yet nothing important is left out.  In particular, S1E3 is one of the most dramatically beautiful episodes of any show I've ever seen, thanks to the lovely guest performances of Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett, and the poignant voice of the glorious Linda Ronstadt in the soundtrack. That episode alone deserves 10 out of 10 stars. Since it's early yet, I'm reserving judgment on the overall series and being conservative with that rating, (the 8 is really 8.5 rounded down), but I'm definitely looking forward to the rest of the season.  Edited 3/14/23:... I'm inclined to downgrade the show overall after watching the season-ending 9th episode. I would say the first 8 episodes deserve a 9 out of 10 stars rating, but the awful insanity of the 9th episode brings it back down to a 7 now. There is no acceptable excuse for what the writers made Joel do in episode 9, regardless of the grossly cold explanation they offered in the post-episode interviews. If Joel does not get the death he deserves in S2E1, I will probably stop watching after that. But I may stop watching anyway, just because I don't see any point to the show continuing with or without his now thoroughly ruined character -- the development of his relationship with Ellie is one of the crucial things that made it work so well for 8 episodes, and it was a relationship that had a foundation of honesty, which has just been shattered for no good reason. Regardless of any statement to the contrary, Ellie must always have doubts about Joel's morality and truthfulness going forward, and I have no desire to see that played out.",9,positive
"What a scary dangerously current movie considering current political situation in Poland with PiS and their way of seeing the world. Of course not only in PL. It scared sh*t out of me.

"It's a bit formulaic, but very enjoyable to watch. The plot moves quickly from the start, without the typical long-winded multi-episode build-up that is the trend these days. Definitely a binge-worthy show.  Alan Ritchson's acting is not great. He's likable, but very rigid (and I don't mean his muscles), and despite his size, his baby face looks isn't all that intimidating, despite how hard he tries. His delivery feels a bit more like someone with Asperger. Henry Cavill may have pulled off Jack Reacher better. But he makes it up with his size and fight choreography that is unquestionably fearsome. Most of the other actors are fairly one-dimensional, but a few veteran faces smooth out the casting. Willa Fitzgerald and Malcom Goodwin are both very good here.  Despite the nice plot pacing and interesting build-up, the climax felt a bit trivial and predictable, and a little bit eyerolling. Still, it's satisfying, if nothing else. I look forward to it getting renewed for a second season that will help further develop Reacher's character (and Ritchson's acting).",9,positive
The show dive into the true motives of each character. They find ways to make you angry at them while also have a sense of what they are going through. Very emotional with the development of each character as well. The development does take a while until you start to fall in love with each character because through each season there is a new cast and it takes time to character build. Even the side characters have something to do with the conclusion of the show. Jennifer Coolidge should win an Emmy once again in 2023. Overall very great show that has lots of different storylines that line up in the end.,8,positive
After hearing so much negative commentary around how this show would turn out prior to the premiere I must say I was astounded. The casting and emotional toll you feel in the first episode which captures the start of the first video game is very intense. They did a great job building tension and it mimicked the events of the first game so well even knowing what happened it was exciting to see it unfold without actually being in the pilot seat playing it. The setting they made for Boston and Austin felt like we were all back there seeing last of us unfold in front of us again with much better graphics. The last of us 1 had one of the best video game stories of any games I have personally played (PlayStation 1 games to current gen) so this season should be phenomenal. Really hoping the episodes After the first hold up to this level of quality and thank you for making this series happen!,9,positive
"I'm happy to say that this show and by all means is the best show I've ever seen in my entire life. I've seen lots of shows as I'm addicted to them, but this one touched something in my heart and soul. If you watched 1883 and 1923 the series, Yellowstone would make sense to you and you will fall in love with the story and it's drama. I love stories that has long history like Yellowstone and how it started. The show had a great beginning and greater closure and this is very rare to see nowadays. I need to recommend this show for people and I would love to see something that has the same greatness one day.",10,positive

"This is every other CW, ABC Family teen drama, nothing new, nothing special. Somehow they made The Addamses boring, except Wednesday, which in this version is a stereotypical whiny brat teenager. They don't think too highly of the audience either, everything is dumbed down to the lowest common denominator, then spelled out and repeated just in case it went over your head. Charles Addams made comics that were separate from the norm, the 60's show brought them into the ""suburbanite"" world and highlighted them as different from the 9-5 husbands and housewives, the 90's movies rewrote Fester's backstory and added to Gomez and Morticia's physical and emotional attraction, this makes Wednesday look dull and especially vanilla. Luckily it's very forgettable.",9,positive
First off the landscape this show is shot on is absolutely gorgeous. For the most part the characters are fully realized with each actor doing great justice to their role. The downside for me is the overarching plot of every season begins to get repetitive with someone new trying to take over the Yellowstone every season. Last but not least is I'm hopeful the events of the last episode(3.10) aren't an indicator of things to come. My biggest worry when I started this show was that the show runner previously acted on sons of anarchy. It was my hope he wouldn't run his show like soa which to me had a problem with every episode having a shootout and deaths. The violence becomes numbing and it really looses its luster when each episode does the same thing. So far for the most part Yellowstone has kept the violence mostly at bay while not being devoid of violence at least there's a semblance of responsibility on the writers part and not to show violence with no consequence. I am very much looking forward to season 4 and I really hope to this show doesn't turn into a small war every episode.,10,positive

"Wow what a quality series. This is a serious Star Wars. When someone dies there is weight to it. Decisions have consequences and this show portrays that well.  The strongest element of this series is the use of the empire. Small time guys who are loyal to the cause. On one hand you root against the empire because they are authoritarian elitist, but on the other hand when their men die the officers take that to heart and so it humanizes them. The dynamic is important in making the villain more than just a one dimensional Marvel villain (with the exception of Thanos).  The cast is excellent, especially the empire characters. Kyle Soller doesn't waste any screen time.  Yes it's a slow burn and I realize that annoys people, but I am an adult and enjoy a show that builds upon itself rather than using as many tropes as possible to keep you excited.",4,negative
"Love the show, especially the well-drawn characters. I also like the many push-pull dynamics between family, the modern world versus the traditional ranching life, and overall the many different worlds and viewpoints that intersect in the show. I particularly like that there are dark/intense moments, but they are well balanced with the feel-good payoff moments. Hope they continue in that direction. So many shows start with great, multi-layered characters and storylines that inspire empathy but then spiral down into darkness, the show eventually turning the characters into people so unredeemable you no longer care about them (Sons of Anarchy, anyone?). And I love Rip!  The only real criticism I have is they say the ""f"" word so much it gets ridiculous and feels contrived. If it's natural to the person or setting, it makes sense. If it's thrown in there just to up the Mature rating, it becomes jarring. I'm not opposed to profanity - it just has to fit the characters, and pretty much every character in the show, from every walk of life, seems to use it every other sentence (I'm expecting Tate to start spouting it any day now, lol). It doesn't fit. The show is awesome - for whatever reason the show's writers are doing it, it isn't necessary.  Otherwise, no criticisms - keep doing what you all are doing - it's a wonderful show!!",10,positive

This season 3 giving us many meaningful, natural, suspension, evil, spirit, friendship, emotional, comedy, jealousy everything perfect. Mike is one of the best director his creative writing skills everything out of this world he's definition of perfection.love the vibe of this season . The family look very distance everyone living in their own world and the three besties they're story look very different from others.",5,neutral
"The Reacher Series are not attempting the novel or insightful. But they seem to be moving away from just a weakly linked sequence of fights and shoot-ups to allow moments where characters actually interact.  Series 1: Despite knowing what Reacher is about, I enjoyed Series 1. Tom Cruise was more convincing, but Ritchson brought his own take and physique to the role.  Series 2: Somehow Series 2 just doesn't carry on the same way. I suspect that is due to 1) dialogue that carries no conviction - just snippets read from a monitor; 2) a set of supporting roles that are completely uninteresting - Series 1 had engaging characters that actually interacted with Reacher instead of feeding him admiring comments, 3) an overall plot that seems to exist only to link fight scenes. 4) Reacher's character in Series 2 also has diminished. Reacher's laconic observations that cast some interest upon his nature in Series 1 are now just brusque observations of little consequence, or weak quips. 5) The filmed settings are prosaic and give a grade B feeling to the entire enterprise.  So the charms of Series 1 are lost. Reacher has fallen to the level of the worst Stallone movies, but now stretched out over many episodes.  Series 3: The project had to do something to recover from Series 2. Series 3 is an improvement over Series 2, but Series 1 still is the best of the three.  The initial episodes of Series 3 are lamentable. Very stiff. Dialogue seemingly unrehearsed, as if a first read from a card they've just been handed. But toward the end things pick up, and the actors approach being real people, not cartoons.  If there is a Series 4, maybe it will loosen the shackles further and aim for more convincing human interactions.",10,positive
"First off, this is a very VERY adult themed show. I don't mean adult as in prophanities or r rated content, well.. that too. But the whole premise of the show and what it's trying to achieve, the theme of it and generally it's whole foundation is aimed towards a very mature audience, mature as in adult. It's not something your typical teenage daugther or son would appreciate and bing, there's a lot of situations and uncomfortable moments adults can relate to and find themself invested in, there's subtle hints and other hidden meanings that pops up through the series that if you blink you'll miss it. It's so much more than just the drama at hand or the issue that shows at that very moment in that episode, it feels like everything has a bigger meaning to it and you are watching, trying to desipher what it all means. Like that one simple conversation or that item on the table that was being focused on, you start analyzing it knowing it has a meaning or symbolizes something.  As the title says, it took me a few episodes to really get into it all and really enjoy the series. But give it a chance and hang on, it is all worth it once you get a feel for how the show is supposed to be and the way it's intended for you to enjoy. It just takes time, trust me. It's worth it.",10,positive

"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)  *Based on the full first season handed to press*  ""The Last of Us is the first live-action videogame adaptation able to finally break the frustrating curse, reaching the so-desired unprecedented level of excellence.  Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann construct a complex character study driven by fascinating protagonists, Joel and Ellie, exploring the grief, traumas, and tragedies of their lives through unimaginable moral dilemmas, emotionally heavy conversations, and devastating moments.  Save for rare exceptions, the episodic narrative formula is remarkably efficient, offering a panoply of intriguing characters and outstanding performances - Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey clearly stand out from the rest. A more intimate, grounded version of a post-apocalyptic world that doesn't lack gory, violent action/horror sequences. Gustavo Santaolalla's score couldn't be a better fit.  If I was already excited to venture into the video game, now I can't wait for that day to come.""  Rating: A-",10,positive

"Honestly, I really liked this series. The first episode is a little strange, and kinda slow-ish? The show plants seeds and with each episode it kinda comes together.  The actors all did an amazing job, the intro has gorgeous aesthetics, and the music is captivating.  Overall, the plot feels like a ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" but with a satirical twist on rich white older families. Which is bound to either have older conservative viewers annoyed with the annoying ""woke"" younger characters, and left-sided viewers annoyed and taking the plot face value as ""white people problems.""  It's a comedy. And a unique character study. There's good drama focused on family dysfunction and upper class vacationists vs resort working staff that can have impactful thrilling moments. However, there's a bunch of lead up to it. The show's a bit slow and more dialogue focused, but it pays off.  To the other poor reviews, I'm willing to bet people didn't really give the short six episode show a chance and instead focused more on their phones.",10,positive
"The show on the surface doesn't always seem good and you may even ask- why am I watching this? But I found that the more I watched the more I was thinking about it and going through the scenes in my mind, there's more below the surface of the show. There's layers involved in the relationships, the social commentary, and the meaning behind things. I find myself discussing it with my husband and it makes for an interesting conversation. I'm not saying that this is the best show I've ever seen but it is good and Jennifer Coolidge is fantastic. If you're looking to be spoon-fed, this is not the show for you.",10,positive
"My idea of watching movies is The Sound of Music and Marry Poppins. This I say as I refuse to watch horror movies and films which show violence. The exception being historical accounts. It took me several days to get through an episode of Season 1 as I couldn't stomach the the violence and horror. At the end of Season 1 I was in such shock that I thought of writing to ask the producers of this show ""Is it really necessary to show so much horror?"": I  I still have not answered this question. However what is so potent about this series is that what we as viewers perceive to be an unthinkable Dystopia is actually a reality for many women living in countries where they are not considered human or are in relationships of abuse. Every time we see this series we should think about the human trafficking that goes on in the world and try to do everything we can to ensure that this remains fiction and not fact.",3,negative

"Binge watched the whole season. After being nothing but disappointed in TFA, TLJ and TROS, it was shocking to see that Disney could actually produce something Star Wars related without mucking it up (although I did like Rogue One and Solo was just ok). Excitement, character development and a story worthy of watching, along with characters from all of the movies sprinkled in here and there. I even liked the subtle humor because it was done correctly and not ridiculously forced like in the films. I just hope that they make a wise decision for once and keep the same team together for the next season because this was awesome.",9,positive

"The Handmaid's Tale was high on my list of series that I wanted to watch. Unfortunately, what was initially intended to be a criticism of a sensitive subject approached in a serious and realistic manner, turns into a poorly constructed spy plot. I finally gave up at the end of season 4...  I loved the first season for its cinematography, music and Elisabeth Moss's masterful performance. I thought the writers had succeeded brilliantly in creating a frightening dystopian world where every wrong move has serious consequences, if not outright death. I particularly liked the scene in which a commander agrees to have his forearm amputated for being guilty of lust. The procedure is cold and surgical, and shows us that no one can escape Gilead's laws. This sense of omnipresent danger effectively creates an atmosphere of terror and despair akin to that felt when watching The Schindler's List.  There's the scene in Spielberg's film where the prisoners find themselves crammed into a large room that they terrified would be a gas chamber, but turns out to be a communal shower. This scene came to mind at the start of season 2, when the maids are carried to the scaffold... then a Kate Bush song breaks the mood! I asked myself, Why? Why add an artificial touch of melodrama to an already terrifying situation?  From that point on, all the annoying little things about the series became more obvious to me: the overuse of slowmotions, the out-of-place songs, the countless zooms in on June's face (and please, stop saying it's to show us her POV; this technique has never been essential for a good actor to show us his inner thoughts. For example, just think of Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump or Cast Away...)  If the series had ended with season 2, I think it would rank alongside True Detective season 1 as one of the best. Unfortunately, the end of the season is more than a little dubious, and the third deconstructs all the rules so well established up to that point.  Added to this are numerous plotholes, a completely illogical plot armor, and a perplexing timeline, such as Hannah and the babies who never grow old, even though everything points to the fact that it's taken quite some time to set up this whole system of laws and customs, including colonies with cemeteries that are already well-stocked. Even the commander says: ""In the old days, we used to cut off a hand; today it's just a finger"".  In short, when the qualities of the first season gave way to script gymnastics (obvious sign of laziness on the part of the writers) and the faults and annoying things became too numerous to be ignored, I decided to abandon, that is to say at the end of season 4.  Too bad, it started off so well...",3,negative
"You idiots that said this was horrible. I would love to know what you think is better?  This is so good it is like a 6 hour film. It rises above the banalities of episodic tv. If you don't think this writing is superior, you have no clue what great writing is. If you can't see the perfection of how every character is arced and there is literally not one scene/line of dialogue that isn't paid off, then you should not be critiquing anything.  Go watch your Marvel films with worn out dialogue and plots so unoriginal that you have seen the same exact thing 500x. It takes a lot of talent these days to make original/modern stories and you are too stupid to have that register in your teeny tiny brains.  For those that say there is nobody to root for? If you really need to root for someone, there is Belinda, the spa lady. I am so sick of people that don't know anything about writing not being able to see great writing when it hits them in the head.  Ok, I had to get that off my chest because I can't stand these haters. I cannot remember the last time I saw something so relevant to the world we are living in right now. It captures our lives at this moment to a T. Mike White has jumped to a new level with this masterpiece that will for sure win a lot of awards.",10,positive
"Wednesday (2022, Netflix) Talk about perfect casting! This iteration of the Addams Family is the slickest yet, but captures the flavour of the previous iterations while bringing it up to modern standards.  All the actors were great, but playing the lead Jenna Ortega absolutely steals the show. She went as far as taking cello lessons, *that* now viral dance, she choreographed herself. On her first take she decided not to blink, & Tim Burton liked it so much they decided that it should be a Wednesday personality trait. She sure has come a long way from playing the Vice President's wheelchair bound daughter in Iron Man 3!  The show was perfextly executed, incredibly slick, production values that felt closer to film than TV. The vibe was very similar to Harry Potter, Scooby-Doo, and Buffy, my only nitpick is that it wasn't as epic in scale as HP. But it is only season 1.  Fantastic soundtrack.  9.1/10, A.",10,positive
"4 ? I was forced to watch all seasons recently and season 2 was by far the best as it had some suspense and thought provoking scenes. But when looking at the entire show...its literally about nothing. Most of the scenes are not linked or have any meaning. People going about their lives. Imagine watching a movie and the actor goes into a store. Thats it. You're left sitting there asking...ok why. As a viewer or audience, ironically, its the very definition of time wasting as we sit in front of a TV.  All seasons seem to share the idea of having at least 2 characters being able to trigger the audience in some obnoxious way, make everyone a potential candidate for death, have some sort of self redeeming or realization moment then ultimately some lack luster death. The white lotus cookie cutter recipe.  Would not recommend watching. There are better shows with substance.",5,neutral
"Don't get me wrong, I loved this show - I loved the acting, the story, the visuals; I loved it. It just has a few flaws and might be a bit overrated. But that's what happens with Netflix shows: (Stranger Things, The Witcher, et cetera) they're great series, but they explode as a trend and become way more popular than they're worth. Not to say that there's something inherently wrong with any show that blows up, but they all have a few flaws. Here are a couple ups and downs of Wednesday.  First of all, Jenna Ortega is absolutely fantastic as her character. Her deadpan, dark sense of humor, and unblinking confidence is captured perfectly. I was a little put off by Emma Meyers' performance as Enid, but it wasn't all that bad.  The main reason I didn't give this show a full 10/10 was the lack of worldbuilding. It was completely unclear how any of it worked, and not in a good way. I wasn't sure if this was a fantasy world or if it was set on Earth--some combination of the two, I guess. With Harry Potter, the creators did this intentionally, but the creators of Wednesday seem to just have forgotten to elaborate upon the setting.",10,positive

"Was never really a fan of the classic ""Addams Family"" series as it was before my time, yet I knew it's impact on culture and I always respected Tim Burton(""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"") who exec produced this ""Netflix"" original series called ""Wednesday"". This series has a spooky modern gothic feel and it's a spinoff of family teen daughter Wednesday Addams(in a super killer turn from Jenna Ortega). The story set in Vermont has Wednesday going off at the age of 16 to attend school and that's ""Nevermore Academy"" which has plenty of spooks and crazy secrets which are connected to the days in which Wednesday's parents attended school there. Wednesday despite feeling out of place makes friends, even when things are not normal as a supernatural murder mystery hangs in the clouds. Along the way nothing or no one is whom they seem it's an expanding murder mystery. Look for actress veteran Christina Ricci(in a wickedly secretive role). In a fun and wild subplot Wednesday deals with her feelings and psychic powers the best she can while trying to solve the ghoulish like murders while learning in high school and fitting in! The series is an entertaining winner that's blended with suspense and well written modern humor! ""Wednesday"" was one well done enjoyable series that I liked watching.",10,positive
"Blessid day people.... What can you say about this?? Underneath all the story and the insane concepts within the show and that is all it is , is a drama. That being said the reality is, that America could go this far, with a civil war looming at time, especially over the last 2 years. You could actually believe this a docu-drama of things to come. It is insane and very gripping. It is not that fast paced but the story is worth the watch if you have the patients. It shows the historically callous side to humanity and what did happen before could very well happen again all because of one book. Scary right!!!! But then the reality is there is more than one book in many languages. It is worth watching  Under his eye.",10,positive
"Wow. This is one of my favorite new series in recent years.  The writing is 100% spot on. Everything scene and every part of the script is an important part of what makes this series special. There isn't ""fluff"" for the sake of adding dialogue.  I'd LOVE if this series was at least 10 episodes per season, and even if each episode was another 10 - 12 minutes longer. I find myself ""thirsty"" to know what will happen next with each character, with each couple, etc.  The first two seasons have similarities, but I appreciate that nothing about season 2 seems repetitive. Everything is original. I'm going to really miss the characters / actors from season 2. But, I know that each season needs to be fresh to keep this amazing program spectacular.  I can't wait for the next episode... and for the next season to start. I don't know how they'll beat the scenery of Sicily. This series has some of the best photography on any program.

One common complaint I see is that this season feels like a collection of side-quests that don't feel connected in any way and that the show doesn't really have an over-arching story. I have to agree. And this isn't a fault of the show itself; the show is based on the book The Last Wish which is just a collection of short stories that aren't necessarily connected. It's hard for a show to have an over-arching story when the thing they are adapting doesn't have one. I imagine this problem will be solved in future seasons when they start adapting the actual novels like Blood of Elves. I'm guessing season 2 or 3 might be the start of the novels and I'm excited for it.,10,positive
"Season 1 is just superb. and requires thinking and attention. Unsure how future seasons of Witcher will go, but hopefully not like Vikings or GOT where it became dulled, predictable and pander to people who preferred to be feed rather than think.

"It's good. I like it. Watching season 3 now. Saw the other seasons when they came out.  If you are into the genre, mercenary badass and associates taking on bad guys, there's not too much not to like. It's entertaining. Remember this is television, not cinema, so judge and expect accordingly. I find it far more watchable than just about everything else on TV.  The acting can be a bit hit and miss. Main character delivers the one liners with genuine impact, but sometimes when he is explaining himself, etc., it can sound a bit monotone. Wooden. Just try not to let it bother you. Other characters have varying degrees of authenticity, sometimes going a bit over the top, but overall, the casting and performances are fine.  There is some decent humor, often deadpan and well done from the lead, and the occasional dose of cheese, which although unfortunate, doesn't stink the place up too badly.  Nice photography and lighting, and good score. Season 3 appears to have leveled up noticeably in these departments.  All in all, it's a good quality show that does not take itself too seriously and with some decent action and mystery. If you like Bourne, Bond, and Bosch type stuff, give it a shot.",10,positive
"Wow, what a wonderful adaptation from the original movies.  This series strikes a wonderful balance between the dark gritty feel of the Netflix Sabrina series, and the world of wonder, colour and delight from the first Harry Potter movie.  All the actors do really well in bringing their characters to life. Needless to say, Jenna Ortega brought her A game and did an amazing job.  Took a bit of time to get used to the way they depicted Wednesdays parents. I know they're based on the original comic but I was expecting to see the flamboyant Gomaz and expressionless like Morticia Adams. But I must say that the quirky warmth plays well to Catherine Zeta-Jones. She did a good job portraying the loving but complicated relationship between a mother and a teen.  Luis Guzmans' portrayal of Gomez was good as well, the character grew on me especially after I watched the series for a 2nd time (it's that good).  The only thing I feel could've been done better was the Hyde monster.  I hope the series comes out with a second season, and they keep it true to this first season, slightly bright and maintaining the development of All the characters and storylines.",10,positive

"Wednesday is amazing. I know of the legacy of the Addams Family, and even though the series is just a spin-off of a series that has been done and redone, I think Jenna Ortega and the cast of Wednesday really nail the whole mission of the series. The humor is relatable yet subtle. The characters are genuine but they seem to hide mysteries that I don't doubt multiple seasons will uncover. Jenna Ortega really embodies the macabre, grim, and valiant character of Wednesday Addams. Her character development is notable as soon as she steps inside Nevermore. I truly hope we get to see more of her and the Academy.",1,negative

"I think the only way you could enjoy this series is if you had never seen the Addams Family movie or older series. Because if you had you could not help but be massively disappointed in this new show. It has lost all of the charm, warmth and wit of the previous show and movie and completely dismantled the original family dynamic. In this new series, they have completely trashed what made the original so wonderful - their love and support of each other and how they embraced and cherished their ""weirdness"".  This show does none of that. Now I read through many 8, 9, and 10 star reviews and if they are legitimate reviews then I am happy so many enjoy this show. But I find those that rated it around 4, 5, and 6 stars seem more in touch with the reality that this show misses the mark in many areas.  So if you like it, that is great! I might too if I wasn't so aware of how much they changed thing around in this version, and not for the better in my opinion.",9,positive
"Jennifer Coolidge is a real delight. Without her and her character's storyline this show would be nothing. Yes, it is dark, funny, twisted, and the writing is creative and imaginative. But ultimately, watching a bunch of miserable rich people despairing over the emptiness of their lives, depressed me more than it entertained me. More importantly, it felt like something I have watched a million times before. I watched this show with some significant delay after it was hyped the way that it was. I was really disappointed as I had expected something fresh and innovative. Season 1 was okay, season 2 was just a repetition of the same stuff, brought nothing new to the table. And I have no idea how they are going to make season 3 work without Jennifer Coolidge. Honestly, without her I'm not even interested in the show.",6,neutral
"There are a few series I would like to binge on, and this is one of them. Firstly, Jenna Ortega owns the screen as Wednesday. The cold stares, the intelligent language, the non-blinking, and the love for violence are all there, and I couldn't be more impressed with the performance Ortega delivered. Secondly, the atmosphere is typical of the Burton films I've watched. Combined with a school environment that we all can relate to, even though most of us are not outcasts.  The show is run clearly by Wednesday, which it should be, thinking of its title, but other characters make a notable mark in the story. Bringing in friendships, love, and mystery makes this story remarkable, and the twists and turns are good. The series' style is typical of Tim Burton but with a twist. Wednesday is the gothic, wearing black and white always, with the rest of the cast being more colorful, or in the case of Enid Sinclair (Emma Myers), Wednesday's roommate, a lot brighter. Wednesday is a total contrast to the rest of the students at Nevermore.  Wednesday, as a series, brings something fresh to the table, even though"" The Addams Family"" is a pretty old story or a cartoon as it was initially. Wednesday is direct, a contrast to the usual teenage stories of today, and while some may see it as dark, it is a story of growth, and there is light at the end, so watch it.",8,positive
"First of all I will say the acting and cinematography is great. The problem for most will be it's really hard to follow what happens when. The show cuts back and forth between scenes happening years apart. I honestly only understood what happened because I read the books.  Also there is way too much character development between the episodes. An example is the thing Yennefer wants and what drives her in the middle episodes. That is a defeining characteristic of her in the books, but here it's just suddenly she wants that. A lot of it feels tacked on because that how it is in the books, but we need to use more time developing the characters in the show.  I think most of it is based on the shows first season is based on short stories. Hopefully it will aline more in upcoming seasons where it will be based on traditional novels",6,neutral

To be fair I'm a huge fan of the empire strikes back but didn't really like the other two in the original series and only liked Revenge of the Sith in the prequels.  This has managed to really create something so much more interesting than anything Disney buggered up with the sequels so far.

We don't know all of the behind the scenes details with the creators and Costner as to what the issues are and we never will.

If you like shows that are more about the internal then the external you should give this a try. A group of wealthy privileged people arrive at The White Lotus a resort for the wealthy in Hawaii. Each of the characters think they are happy but each one of them quickly starts going through what amounts to an Existential Crisis.  If you want a show with likeable characters this isn't really it. Most of the characters especially in the beginning start out very unlikeable but through the six episodes of the series you actually do find out why they act the way they act.  Still this is worth the watch especially since it is only six episodes.,7,neutral

"Well, I guess you'd have to say it was Taylor Sheridan, and, let me tell you, he was RIGHT! This is some of the most impressive scriptwriting I've seen in...ever. The characters are well drawn, meticulously understood by the writer, with each and every nook, cranny, misanthrope or fracture ready to be drawn upon as needed, to simultaneously crush with emotional disturbance, and make you understand what is at stake, in the heart achingly beautiful reality of Yellowstone. Because, this story happens right in the bosom of the real star of the show: the land, surrounded by purple mountain majesties, evergreens and wide open spaces. As John Dutton says early on, ""if a man had all the money in the world, this is what he would buy."" For land, particularly undeveloped, pristine, wild land in the American West, is a limited thing. When it's gone, it's gone, and everybody knows that.  John Dutton, the patriarch and owner of Yellowstone ranch, has created a true disaster from a lifetime of being the hard, taciturn master that was required. This robbed his children of the time and admiration of a loving father, which is what they would buy if hey had all the money in the world.  Now, they're grown, and it's too late. In his final years, when he wants to make amends and play with his grandkids, his children all hate him for their own personal reasons, and in many ways, can't wait for him to be gone so they can just do away with this huge chunk of land that has been a prison for their entire lives. They all want to move on, but can't cut loose of the past, especially when its reins are the hands of their powerful, ruthless father.  The way Mr. Sheridan started killing off major characters in the first episode, I was beginning to wonder if anybody would be left for the rest of the season. He had it right, though. By the end of the pilot, I was completely convinced that no one in this move is safe. Just because you're a major star doesn't mean you won't end up dead before the end of any episode. Being a character in a Taylor Sheridan script is dangerous. Many don't make it. Because the story may require their death to proceed. Very similar to real life, when you think about it.  Although every character in Yellowstone is fascinating, the one that gets to me the most is Beth Dutton, John's only daughter, played by Kelly Reilly. Perfectly cast with Reilly, Beth is a tortured soul, carrying a guilt about her mother's death, and a hardness pounded into her by her mother and father. Now a voluptuous but aging woman, she's extremely intimidating, capable and completely captivating. She's a woman who has no boundaries, no shame, and no patience for weakness. She consumes men like a Black Widow spider, with a cynical smile. When daddy needs her, however, she's on the next plane, and her first question is ""Just tell me who to fight."" Daddy says ""Everyone."" And she does.  Beth is John Dutton's secret weapon, like a nuclear smart bomb he can release on those who need to be taken down. She's capable of evil, which none of John Dutton's other children seem to be. Evil is what John is going to need to win the battle to hold on to his way of life, and leave a legacy for his family.  Beth is a seething, broken person, with the brand of Yellowstone on the inside, where nobody sees it. She's a train wreck, and the question that hangs in the air around her is, will this woman destroy us all, or save us, like a gladiator? By the end of the first season, I'm not sure. That's why I'll be downloading season 2 as soon as its available.  My next favorite character is Tate Dutton, (Brecken Merrill), son of Kayce Dutton (Luke Grimes), the youngest of John Dutton's children. Tate's mom is an Indian girl, Monica Dutton, well played by Kelsey Asbille.  Tate, age 6 or so, is a real badass. Here's a kid who is growing up on an Indian reservation in Utah, with a white father who has somehow stolen the heart of a beautiful Indian girl and their love has created this beautiful, brave little boy. This makes him an outcast as an Indian and as a white kid. He's a real fighter, an attribute I would guess he's going to need in upcoming seasons, as he grows up and becomes more a part of the fight. The two sides of his family tree, Indian and Dutton, are enemies. Always have been. Now, the Indian nation has vowed to get the land back from the white intruders. This young kid, Tate, is going to be right in the middle of it. I can't wait to see how Sheridan develops this character. It's going to be fun. And this young actor Brecken Merrill, is up for the task. Some of his moments on screen steal the show from everybody. You can't take your eyes off this kid. He's phenomenal.  What I'm struck by the most in ""Yellowstone"" is the richness of the story. The trusty ol' cowboys and Indians trope is redefined and brought into the 21st century, with characters that are unique, and believable. Nothing seems staged or forced. It's just, simply, what would John Dutton do in a situation like this? Or Beth? Or Tate? Good or bad, the story lives with the consequences, and marches on down its inevitable path to destruction. There's going to be a lot of dead people. Some might even deserve it. When you pit 3 opposing forces against each other - the land owner, the Indians, and the encroaching land developers - who all hate to lose, and play for keeps, things are going to get ugly. There may not even be a good guy or a bad guy at the end, no matter the color of their hats.  It may just all be wrong, it may be that these people are trying to deal with horrors committed by their ancestors, with resentment and hatred that has gone on too long and can't be fixed. You see this sort of thing causing wars, terrorism, refugees, atrocities all over the globe, due to the clashes of differing races, religions or cultures.  Well, it happened in America as well. We just try not to think about it all that much. Thanks to Taylor Sheridan, the spotlight is now turned on. I can't wait to see what happens next in Sheridan's Yellowstone, a fascinating and entertaining new story about The American West.",7,neutral
"Could have been better and could have been worse. Nothing ground shattering here. Crime, tough guy, cover ups. All been done before and will be done again. Started with a promise of something more, but each episode seems to lower the expectations and become more stereotypical for the genre. Watch it for the big guy and move on.",6,neutral
"This is great fun. Jenny Ortega is a convincing and very likeable Wednesday. She finds a perfect balance in playing the superficially mean and scary lead armed with a whole host of deadpan one liners and put downs whilst simultaneously showing us that Wednesday is actually a very smart and decent kid. The wider cast is universally good as well, particularly Emma Myers as Enid and Hunter Doohan as Tyler. There's a great style to the series particularly in the early episodes and when she makes her sparse appearances Catherine Zeta Jones steals a scene or two as a very alluring Morticia. There's also a great role for Thing throughout this first season. Overall it's a fresh and at times very funny production that breathes new life into the Addams family and usually leaves you with a smile on your face.",9,positive
"I would first like to say that every actor is a delight. It's so fun to see the adults, and the young adults are talented. But after a few episodes, I felt like I was watching a CW teen show. Nothing special about the filming or script.  Wednesday is a misfit in a school of misfits. Like, what? She's so much more entertaining around ""normal"" people, who end up looking like the real weirdos.  The dance sequence that has gotten so much media coverage is actually quite good. But watch it on YouTube.  Watch the first few episodes for the fun actors, then walk away like I did. This is a bore and is not worthy of the average IMDB rating.",3,negative

"I know people are in love with this series and I shake my head and wonder why?  I couldn't not get through season 1, it was so dumb and underdone.  But, I thought I'd give season 2 a try... because I have a streak of attraction to the macabre? I'm not sure.  I will say the fact that it was in Sicily, attracted me.  I haven't been there yet and I wanted to meet its charm up close and personal.  I will say the series served as a Chamber of Commerce commercial for ""Come To Sicily!"" It was beautiful to look at. The 3 stars are for the Cinematography.  However, when you go to Sicily, be sure to lock up your naive, gullible sons, watch your wallets, learn to easily recognize the local criminals, avoid the streets and lock all of your doors.  WTF they treated Sicilians with such disrespect. I would be incredibly offended if I were Sicilian.  The carrots were dangled and dangled and dangled and NOT ONE OF THEM ever paid off.  AND THEN when the action actually FINALLY does happen in the last 10-minutes of episode 7... they wanted to make sure you knew something horrible was brewing with Aetna spitting fire in the background.  REALLY... REALLY?  They chose ridiculous storylines that were more melodramatic than daytime soaps in the 1970s. Is that what people like to watch these days?  Or are we simply THAT BORED so we will watch anything?  Even a poorly written, overacted, predictable POS?  I would rather rewatch The Sopranos from S1E1 than sit through another one of these barely passable, tepid, at best, ""dramas.""  If we keep watching and praising schlock like this... chances are very strong, they will keep making it. Joy, joy.  Enough!  STOP GREENLIGHTING SH***Y SHOWS!",1,negative
"WEDNESDAY is awesome, one of the best shows i have seen on Netflix!!!!! The acting of Jen O is so good, she is wonderful as Wednesday, her delivery of her lines is perfect! She alone makes Wednesday worth watching. Then there is Tim Burton, he has done a wonderful job of bringing this sbow to life, the mood, the camera work, the sets, is all deliciously wonderful. The supporting cast is also very good, i love Thing!!! Then there is the story, that has so many levels, Wednesday's life and conflict with her family, a new school, Wednesday and her visions, the creature killing in the forest, and what mysteries are going on at the school. Wonderfully yummy tv!",10,positive
"This is a true masterpiece!  I've been binging season 1 & 2 whitin a couple of days and I literally can't stop watching! The show has a lot of twists & turns you won't expect. I love everyone's performance in this show as well!  It's a dark comedy and I've never seen anything like it. I can imagine this show could have infinite seasons and I truly hope they will never stop making new seasons of ""The white lotus"".  It's a pleasure to watch. I've not seen a boring episode so far and I'm starting season 3 today!  I really love the cinematography and the locations they have used to shoot this series! I'm hoping they'll make a new season in at my favourite Island ""Bali"" one day'. If not, I'll continue watching anyway ;)",9,positive

"As with the title, don't expect character development on this series (except for one in Season 1). Instead, the characters spiral downward deep into their flaws. I don't know what the exact word is but ""degeneration"" comes to mind. Needless to say, this series is excellent in its delivery. The creator wants to show us the cringe-worthy behavior of the elite and how they leave chaos wherever they go. It succeeds in that while treating viewers with beautiful sceneries, thrilling mysteries and masterfully crafted scenes and stories.  Personally though, the aspect I enjoyed the most out of this show is its cinematography. More than its acting and storyline (which it receives well-deserved praises for), I found the shots very enticing. At the end of each season, there will be an itch to travel to these locations and stay at these hotels (but they are not for us plebs unfortunately - 3000 USD per night??).",7,neutral
"1. Plot: It's a story set in between two world wars, about a man who rises above all his obstacles to form a powerful gangster family in England. 2. Acting: The cast overall has a unit brings out the best in them with standout performance from Cillian Murphy (Thomas Shelby). (can't believe he has not received a Emmy for this role) 3. Cinematography: Visuals are a piece of artwork with stunning backgrounds that capture old age England. (Slow-motion shoots are a thing to watch) 4. Character Development: The show comes second best to Breaking Bad in terms of Character Development (which is a great feat by itself). The characters of the Shelby family grow beyond hardships to narrate us a gripping story along with the main character. 5. Music: All the above mentioned points are taken to new heights by the Background Scores. Theme music (Red Right Hand) sets you up to the tone of the show.",5,neutral
"First let me just say, I'm a huge Addams fan! So when I heard about Wednesday I was beyond apprehensive to say the least. But with Tim Burton being apart of the first season I had some hope. (Also a Tim Burton Fan) Within the first few minutes I knew this show was going to be great! Jenna Ortega is the perfect Wednesday. The script is phenomenal and is not cheesy. The show is not overly gory but definitely takes a lot of suspenseful twists and turns which leaves you wanting more. I also love that they cast Christina Ricci the OG Wednesday as Marilyn Thornhill. Overall each character had a decent storyline where enough information is given without being too complex and muddying the story. I can not wait for Season 2! Netflix don't let me down!!",10,positive
"I didn't think they could do this game justice... Boy was I wrong!  The characters are all amazingly represented, minus Ellie ATM for myself... The jury is still out on her, though I love her as an actress.  It's not the Walking Dead at all and it totally keeps you involved with the story line.  The way they frame things is so accurate, you can tell they did their homework and KNEW us fans would be up their butts about details.  However lol I do wish the neighbours were called ""The Cooper's"" thought that was a missed opportunity but like... If that's the reason why someone doesn't like the show. They can go watch something else cause this show for episode one... Is very well done! Cannot wait for the rest of the series!",10,positive
"Peaky Blinders isn't just a TV show; it's a gripping saga that immerses viewers in the gritty underworld of post-World War I Birmingham, England. Loosely based on a real English gang from the 19th century, the series follows the Shelby family as they navigate the treacherous waters of power, money, and betrayal.  At the heart of the show are the anti-heroic characters, led by the enigmatic Tommy Shelby, portrayed with chilling intensity by Cillian Murphy. Despite their morally ambiguous actions, the characters evoke sympathy and intrigue from the audience, making for a captivating viewing experience.  The series is a masterclass in storytelling, with each episode packed full of plot twists, intrigue, and drama. From the meticulously crafted dialogue to the stunning cinematography, every aspect of ""Peaky Blinders"" is executed with precision and skill.  One of the show's standout features is its stellar cast, which includes powerhouse performances from the likes of Helen McCrory, Paul Anderson, and Sophie Rundle. The addition of guest stars such as Tom Hardy and Adrien Brody adds further depth and complexity to the ensemble.  The attention to detail is evident throughout the series, from the meticulously recreated period setting to the carefully curated soundtrack. The juxtaposition of modern rock music against the backdrop of 1920s Birmingham adds to the show's edgy atmosphere, while the stunning visual effects bring the era to life in vivid detail.  ""Peaky Blinders"" is more than just a gangster drama; it's a thrilling journey into the heart of darkness, where loyalty and betrayal collide in a deadly game of power and ambition. With each episode building towards a breathtaking climax, it's no wonder that the show has garnered widespread acclaim and a dedicated fanbase.  In conclusion, ""Peaky Blinders"" is a must-watch for anyone craving high-quality drama with a twist of historical authenticity.

"Wednesday, the gothic daughter of the Addams family, is getting her own mini series on Netflix - how does the young Addams do, since she is a misfit even in a school for misfits?

Bad, sensitive, especially towards her brother, a bad wolf, rational and talkative in black and white - that's one The Addams Family fan knows and loves Little Wednesday (Ortega)!

I love sci-fi and I didn't love this show. It just reminded me of how much I hate religion and the oppression of women. It incited anxiety that is always there to the point where I don't even want to talk about the show. And the goddamn whispering acting drives me crazy. Stop whispering actors. It was however shot beautifully. Why don't the women do something. All the women!! There's like ten women who like it and what's the rest of the country doing. Gah just makes me angry.

"So I gave the 5 stars because I really loved the first season of the show. I wanted to give this an 8 but the second season was just so painful to watch and ruined everything for me.  The first season has characters that we care for with a really great story. Every episode had me excited and I would be upset when it was done. I always thought, ""an hour was not enough!"" And couldn't wait for the next episode to come out. It truly was great tv.  Season 2 took a turn for the worst. I found myself losing my patience with the slow paced episodes and it made me feel like I was watching the walking dead instead. More focus on teen drama and how horrible humans are instead of the conflicts with zombies and surviving.  Somehow logic went out the window for most of these characters. Of all people, Ellie should know better. But they had to dumb her down in order to make their story progress in the direction they wanted it to.  Most of the characters are one dimensional and didn't make me care for them. The only one I was rooting for was Jesse as he had a sense of responsibility and care for others unlike Ellie who seems to forget about everyone else but herself and her quest for revenge.  We hardly saw any zombies except for the second episode. Introducing the more advanced zombies was absolutely pointless as we only get a total of 5 minutes of them being on screen. The weird cult seemed pointless as well, although I'm sure they'll circle back to it in season 3.  Bella Ramsey as Ellie was only good for portraying a kid in season 1, but she isn't a good fit for season 2 in a more mature role. Joel is the only character worth watching and it helps that we have a good actor like Pedro Pascal playing him. Ellie cannot carry the story alone and it's a shame that Joel was taken out so early on in season 2.  In conclusion, season 2 was so bad that I have no desire in watching season 3. It's all about dread and gives no point to anything any of the characters do. I recommend only watching season 1 and completely forget that they made a second season.",9,positive
"The White Lotus is certainly compelling television. It is full of terrible human beings doing awful things to each other. The first season built tension better than most dramas in recent memory and while it was often hard to watch for that reason it navigated the line between real life and entertainment quite well. Sadly, the second season lacked all of these virtues. I think the outrageous nature of the story lines in the first year flowed organically whereas in year two, they felt contrived and forced. Even the trademark landscape transitions, while overly bloated, were beautiful in Hawaii, but seemed mostly CGI in Italy. The failures of season two are likely a byproduct of the first season being very popular and HBO wanting to capitalize off of that popularity. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear Mike White had a strong idea for the follow up and that made it fall flat. This type of thing happens to a lot of shows that no one expected to blow up. It was also disappointing that the only character to return was Jennifer Coolidge's Tanya. Everyone loves the actor, so I'm sure she was popular and that made them want her to be the lynch pin for the series. Unfortunately, I found her story line to be the least interesting in both seasons. The first season is absolutely worth a watch and it will likely hoodwink you into going straight into season two like it did with me. Hopefully you will have more fun with it than I did.",10,positive
"If you've ever lived in Iran after the Islamic revolution, this is almost exactly what is happening in the country. Iranians are very open minded and from the first day the mandatory Hijab became the law for women, there were protests everywhere for it. After a while people started to give up and instead live double lives: one in public places for example in government offices or in the streets where ""morality police"" was there to fine everyone who doesn't obey the law and send them to the police office if they fight with that. And another life in their personal gatherings and in their homes. So most people didn't accepted the kind of lifestyle that the government tried to create for them. So the Hijab here (in the personal life) from a symbol of religious belief, bacame a symbol of supporting the totalitarian government.  So this show is very relatable for Iranians.",10,positive

It is a rare example of a TV adaptation that does justice to its source material while also standing on its own as a fantastic piece of entertainment. One of the biggest strengths of the show is its casting. Alan Ritchson is the perfect choice to play Jack Reacher, capturing the character's physicality, wit, and intelligence.

Please please give Ritchson some acting lessons and cast actors who know how to act in other characters! In 'The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare' his acting was not that bad, so I suppose in the hands of a decent Director he can do a decent acting job.

"Netflix should fire producers, directors and writers.  01. The inclusion of people of color was poorly planned. I'm not against it, but you can do it more carefully, even to preserve actors who end up being attacked for doing their job. For example, they could have made all the elves people of color, even putting an interesting social critique in it while having relevant roles ended up being destined for people of color. This carelessness is made worse by the fact that it is a Slavic story, which could and should involve Slavic actors, who also have little space in the film industry.  02. There is a lot of racism in the criticism against actors who are physically different from how their characters are presented in books and games, but several cases of miscasting only makes it worse. A good example of this is Anya Chalotra, the female protagonist, whose character in the games looks like Eva Green/Alexandra Daddario, but which Chalotra - a good actress, very beautiful and charismatic - manages to deliver. There's a lot less complaining about her, even though she's a leading lady, because there's much of the character in her and she acts well. In other words: she was well casted...  03. All this fuss would be irrelevant if the writing was good and faithful, but the writing is really bad and strays from the source material for no reason.  04. The first season could be much better. The following ones should stick to Witcher 3 stories. Reinvent a story with millions of fans is not only disrespectful: it is stupidity and incompetence at the highest level.  05. I could believe that this fiasco is due to prejudice against video game stories, but Amazon did the same with Tolkien, whose quality is absolutely indisputable. Netflix could have made a lot of money and delivered a product of artistic value. But no...  Fire these incompetents and start over in a year or two. Stop hurting the material.",6,neutral
"As a fan of the Addams I was really exited to watch the series, especially since it's highly recommended on the Internet.  In my opinion, the show seems off. The main character, Wednesday, is just a bratty teenager that gives off the most cringey vibe. The second hand embarrassment that'll get from this show is real.  The writing is just bad... It's full with teenage school drama that I don't really get and the word 'patriarchy' thrown around for wokeness points. The jokes aren't funny, nor witty, they are there to fill some pages and some screentime.  I'm glad that there are people who really like the show, but for me it's just a parody of a reboot.",10,positive
"Peaky Blinders is, without a doubt, one of the best TV series I've ever watched. It's a cinematic masterpiece that seamlessly blends gripping storytelling with impeccable performances. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Tommy Shelby is nothing short of mesmerizing-every man should witness his craft and learn from the depth and nuance he brings to his character.  The entire cast delivers standout performances, each bringing their roles to life with authenticity and intensity. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the gritty beauty of post-WWI Birmingham in stunning detail. The series is further elevated by its brilliant direction and a hauntingly perfect soundtrack that adds layers to the narrative.  From its razor-sharp dialogues to its intricate plotlines, everything in Peaky Blinders is executed with precision. It's not just a show-it's an experience that leaves you thinking long after the credits roll. For anyone who appreciates top-tier drama and powerful storytelling, Peaky Blinders is an absolute must-watch.",10,positive
"Burton and Elfman have collaborated on so many over the top masterpieces that a person might believe the subject matter and actors don't even matter. They could take the lamest wokest most cliche'd set of tropes, or, for instance, one of the insufferably adolescent Stephen King stories, and turn it into something magic and memorable. That being said, the lead actress is stellar, capturing a morbid cloud and still emitting rays of humor and beauty. It is also a surprise and delight that the giant warrior lady from game of thrones is quite a salty actress in more tame surroundings. The only other point IS the selection of material. The Addams family, which kind of invented dark slapstick, is really a daunting subject for a remake/sequel. Never fear. Or, should I say, always fear.",9,positive

"After binge watching the first season Yellowstone has my attention. I'll definitely watch the other seasons as well. A Western series isn't the easiest genre to keep it interesting all the time but in Yellowstone there are enough twists and turns to keep you interested.

The cinematography is worth the detour, nice sceneries from Montana.

"Well, I guess I'm pretty jaded. I thought this was amusing, watchable, the cast members were likable, the locations for seasons 1 and 2 were beautiful.  But I am just flabbergasted by the number of awards given to this series. Are we rating on a bell curve? (I think so.)  This was very watchable and very streamable (I stayed up very late getting to the end of the second season one night) but I don't even know if I'll remember it in a couple of years. Despite the debate about this, it just seemed to me to be another HBO series about rich, white folk doing whatever they please and sometimes agonizing about it.  I did not see this when it originally ""dropped"" but binged it after the end of the second season. I enjoyed Rita Coolidge, F. Murray Abraham, Simona Tabasco, Alexandra Daddario, Beatrice Grannò, and a couple of others, but basically I found this series to be a time filler.  As far as humor, yes, it's light-hearted, and I realize it's more satire (well, is it?) but, at most, I found myself actually *laughing* not more than once an episode.  Like I say, I guess I'm jaded.",3,negative
"This review is based on Season 1, and I haven't played the video game. The general plot involves a weary middle-aged man and a young girl bonding on a quest in post-apocalyptic America. The first few episodes contain a lot of post-apocalyptic excitement. The first episode showing the world unraveling from a contagious fungus is excellent, and the second episode is almost unbearably tense as the heroes barely evade the horrifying fungal creatures. And then something goes wrong. Perhaps the writers ran out of good filmable source material. In a nine-episode series, there's two entirely superfluous episodes, one involving a love story between two men and a flashback episode involving the girl. Both episodes seem oddly out of place and do nothing to advance the plot. Also, as the pair works their way west into less populated areas, the threat comes from other humans, and the fungal creatures barely seem to be a danger at all.  The two travelers gradually form a quasi-father/daughter relationship, but some of the editorial choices are odd. By far the most compelling character in the show is the older man, well-acted by Pedro Pascal, who feels his age and begins to doubt his competence as the pair makes their way west. But the show focuses more heavily on the young woman who, while she's strong-willed and intelligent, hasn't lived long enough to be all that interesting. Imagine a version of ""True Grit"" where the focus is not on the aging gunfighter but on the girl he's trying to protect.  The show looks good and the early episodes have moments of intense excitement, but there are several easily skippable episodes, and the latter episodes move slowly at times. The ending is a disappointing anti-climax. Overall, if you like this sort of science fiction, I think this is a qualified thumbs up.",10,positive
"I had left a hasty review after watching the first three episodes of Season 2 of Andor, I was not happy, but I MUST eat crow,the last 5 episodes were nothing less then spectacular. What we must understand is that this series is an espionage THRILLER, dealing with the infancy and forming of the Rebellion. Don't get me wrong there is plenty of action in this series, but it is a dialogue and character development piece. The acting was fantastic, so sad to know a lot of the main characters fate in the future will be devastating.  On a side note, I have to admit SW fans are probably the most critical and a lot of times ridiculous in their opinions. I am a fan in my 60s fortunate enough to see ALL of the films in first run, starting in 1977, there have been some very less desirable features over the past 10 years and people can say Disney ruined SW, and maybe in some ways they have. But Andor and Rogue One are as good as any of the original films, and I feel the reason is because people want the back stories that deal with the rebellion and the original Jedi Knights. The off shoot characters, Mandolrean, Book of Boba Fett,Ashoka, have less to do with those stories. With that being said, maybe less is better. MSWGA Making Star Wars Great Again.",9,positive
"Overall I was satisfied with this series. It was not a home run, but it was definitely watchable. I thought Jenna Ortega played the part of Wednesday very well, and Catherine Zeta Jones made a good Morticia. The actor who played Uncle Fester reminded me of the original series depiction. I didn't have any major problems with any of the school mate characters or actors. The story and tone were on key, which I was happy with. It almost had a Harry Potter-esque vibe going on and a hint of Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow. The art direction was on point. The story stayed focused on Wednesday, which is a good thing. After all this wasn't an Addams Family show. The downside was the CG for the monster was a bit wonky and low quality. Also Gomez and Pugsley were a bit of a let down, but they aren't a major part of the show, so it did t subtract too much.",9,positive
"While the movie is following the book, the biggest problem I have with it is that it's in fact shot as sitcom, rather than thriller/suspense it was supposed to be. The whole atmosphere is what is creating it - the music, everyone's body language, camera, everything. The end result is that everything feels generally wrong, the threats the protagonist is facing don't look serious, and there's no thriller feeling.",10,positive
"With IMDB of 8.6 and first few episode constant killing give me high expectation on the show. But no more than 3 episode in make me feel very bored. Every problem get solved so easy with barely any repercussions. Constantly introducing new enemies and then killing them in 2 seconds is not how you keep the flame.  Every character constantly trying to look badass when delivering the lines make it's hard to believe or interest. John Dutton (Kevin Costner) is the only character i'm interested (3 seasons and 3 episode in) and i still have several doubts on his decisions and character.  Wild West - Cowboy theme mixed with politics and Indian tribe but none get fully delivered (only when it's convenient) make it very paled.  The main focus is the Duttons have a lot of similarities with the Roys in Succession (similar to the new episode releasing date) but i can say that Succession had done way better than Yellowstone.  I'm still watching the show, but a little disappointed from the high expectation.  Edit: At episode 9 of season 4, I give up. Boring and overrated show.",9,positive
"To start with, I should point out that I was pretty indifferent to the character Cassian Andor before watching this series so wasn't particularly excited about him getting his own series (much unlike Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ahsoka). Maybe because of that, I found the first couple of episodes pretty slow and it just didn't have me hooked. However, to say that I'm glad I went back to it and then stuck with it would be an understatement!  There are some great characters in this show and some brilliant (if despicable) ideas, and when they put the whole picture together it was fantastic. I didn't like all of it, there were definitely a few things I would have liked to have seen done differently, but for the most part it was really enjoyable and I'm looking forward to rewatching it!  Also, Fiona Shaw was in it (and was great) so that's always a win.  If you find the start a little slow, hang on in there. It's well worth it.",10,positive
"One of the greatest tv shows i have ever seen in my life, all the seasones are just amazingly done, high recommended.",10,positive
"Usually Netflix originals are compete drivel, and unfortunately Tim Burton hasn't been on his game for at least a decade but this was great fun.  You're endeared to Wednesday perhaps even more so than in other adaptations, Jenna Ortega did a great job, as did the rest of the cast. Lots of misdirects to keep you guessing and no lazy writing to pander to the usual Netflix crowd.  The character development for the main cast was great, everybody got their moment.  Frightening & violent enough to make it feel naughty for kids to watch (very in keeping withe Addams feel) whilst keeping it interesting for adults too.  There are enough nods to the source material and ealier adaptation that it'll keep older fans happy, but it is definitely it's own thing.  Got a long wait for S2 now!",8,positive
"Technically, this is mostly well-made, acting is great, cinematography is great, music is well done, good sound editing. Unfortunately the script, this being TV, is required to drag this relatively short book, into infantum with nothing to add but boredom.  I watched the 1992 film first, and I found that to be ridiculous, but entertaining, it took a satirical tone and seemed to understand just how stupid ""The Handmaid's Tale"" actually is. This is a truly dumb story on so many levels, the characters are not very compelling, and the 1992 movie does us a favor by only being 90 minutes. This series just drags on and on, I was bored, the exact story told in the movie in 90 minutes is dragged into many episodes here, with absolutely no humor, just drag colors and a constant depressing tone that never lets up, fine for a movie, but for 5 season series? Not so much. . I can tolerate feminist works when they are actually entertaining, such as the original ""The Stepford Wives"" all the men are evil there, but again, it has humor and knows it is ridiculous. I even didn't mind the obviously feminist ""Invisle Man"", also with Moss. This series is bogged down by a dull and drawn out story that is so depressing and dull by the first 4 episodes I don't know how ANYONE can like this? How are feminist still pretending they are oppressed in western society is beyond me, unless we are talking about the erasure of biological women by ""trans women"". Seriously. This series is nothing but massive gaslighting and does NOTHING to help women, in fact, series such as this hurt women by making them into negative whiny brats and all the men into controlling patriarchal caricatures with no depth.  Total waste of time and money, what a crock of crap. Watch the 90 minute movie instead, you'll get the gist.",7,neutral
"So the first episode had me sitting on the edge of my seat, as it follows the storyline of the game quite accurately. I had my doubts about Pedro Pascal as Joel, but boy was I proven wrong! Kind of like Robert Pattinson's as Batman. The series is slow paced enough for anyone to Enjoy but the Eerie atmosphere quickly pulls you into the story. I think Gamers can appreciate the accuracy with which the first episode was created. The special effects will put many Hollywood blockbusters to shame and the Atmos soundtrack is among the best out there. I won't be spoiling anything, but I can hardly remember a show having me on the edge of my seat like this one, especially due to the Atmos soundtrack, the excellent special effects And just the dark side of humanity when the proverbial sh*t hits the fan.  I have never given out a 10 as I usually feel there is room for improvement, but they've outdone themselves with this one. 10/10 hands down.",10,positive
"The Reacher movies and this TV series have the same titular character name but are very different.  Reacher is an interesting, engaging character in this series. He's like an autistic action hero. His mind gives him analytical powers but it stops him from connecting with people. Time is spent on developing the character. His childhood as an army 'brat' shipped around the globe is explored for example. Ritchson is totally convincing in the Reacher role.  The supporting characters are also pretty well fleshed out and likeable. There is plenty of dry humour and intelligence in the script. The action scenes are superbly executed. You can feel the hits. It's well produced using the small town locations to great effect.  If you want to watch an enjoyable, suspenseful action packed series with a twist, you should definitely reach for this series. Don't let those so-so movies put you off.",9,positive
"Powerful stories and characters that mix well together. The show has more than its fair share of dirty politics, family drama, murder for hire, cowboys, horses, revenge, social injustice. It is well written, beautiful cinematography, and the actors play their parts well. You will love them all and at times, hate them all.",8,positive
"I really love this show. I can't help but wonder why this woman was cast. She's insanely unattractive. I could understand just a normal, not beautiful, but not ugly either person for the role, but she reminds me of a pug. I can't stop watching but I'm so tired of that face.",10,positive
It was so nice that I finished it in 3 days. I watched it continuously. Jenna Ortega is no doubt an extraordinary talented actress. The way she portrays as Wednesday Addams is mind blowing. And her dance in gugu muck is very nice and I was addicted to it. That dance is a killer performance ??And the ending is unexpected and it's a nice suspense thriller kind of series. It's a treat to watch the whole location/set. And each and every character is unique. According to me it's a must watch. I recommended this to my friends and family. I have been waiting for season 2. I wish it gets released soon.,8,positive
"What made me love S1 so much was the fact that each character has both positive and negative sides. So even when they annoyed you, you still kind of relate to them in some aspects and even root for them. If I didn't like a character, I still thought ""oh, but I understand where they're coming from, it's just difference in life principles and experiences "". S1 was a good mix of humor and drama and social criticism and this bag of complicated feelings about the characters.  Sadly i think in S2, the characters are not as well written. Some of them are just down right horrible and I just can't find a way to relate or justify what they did. The setting is better tho because there are more views outside of the resorts and Sicily is beautiful... But the storyline itself... I'm really not sure where it's going. Disappointingly less emphasis on the resort staffs themselves when I thought that was the premise of the show. And I feel like there are just so many characters that we're trying to keep up with. Ngl i was excited for the first couple episodes but the development of the characters and stories are definitely don't live up to the expectations.",7,neutral
"After watching the last episode, I paused for thought.  Through the pandemic- corona-disaster of 20-22 this was the series that held together stronger than super glue. Whether the first episode where Thomas Shelby rides in with his black horse or the very last where the white horse rides out, it reeks of passion, anger, pride, angst, fear or fight. The set is atmospheric with its magnificent shades of grey and as ironic as an oxymoron. The casting is probably second to many nuns. Aunt Polly was a goddess glorious by her demise. Arthur showed a ridiculous alcoholic mess.  Music be magnificent enhancing every moment. A masterpiece .",10,positive

"Having looked forward to Wednesday for months, unfortunately it turned out to be a disappointment.  The first few episodes were okay but further down the road Wednesday actually starts to get feelings.  In my opinion Wednesday Addams should always be heartless like in previous black and white tv shows and like in the Addams movie cyclus.  Dark, gloomy, black, rotten.... That is how the full show should have been. Instead, it was un-Tim Burton-esque... Too... ""Normy""... Let's hope that in the second series mr. Burton does what he always did. Make it creepy, kooky, mysterious and spooky, strange, deranged.",9,positive
"Those who cannot see the clear and direct parallels between this well-executed drama and the direction America is being driven, are simply delusional.  The flashbacks show the slow-motion creep of authoritarianism, cloaked in theocracy and how Americans reacted with deer-caught-in-headlights reflexivity, until it was too late.  It's a stunning, sobering, hard stare into the dystopian near-future unless Americans stand up, United and defend The Constitution of this country against those who seek to subvert it.",6,neutral

"We enjoyed seasons 1 and 2. Unfortunately season 3 seems to exist as the Mandalorian version of Star Wars, Return of the Jedi, the Ewok merchandise money grab. Basically it's a vehicle to market Baby Yoda merch. The writing and direction play as afterthoughts. The narrative is now just a jumble of pointless opportunities for the green puppet to do cute things. The first two seasons had that delightful space western feel. This feels like the longest Super Bowl ad ever made. A collection of quality actors who always bring their A-game, the production just abandoned them in favor of a padded out, pointless exercise in greed.",7,neutral
"I probably should be used to not agreeing with the masses by now...but really thought this was going to be so much better given all the hype. I thought the acting was mostly very good. But the story line was boring - didn't go anywhere! Parts of the narrative were just downright tedious.  One thing that baffles me is inclusion of the trainee who in ep 1...it felt like she was going to be a part of the storyline, and there was (too much) drama around it, and then it was irrelevant and so disconnected from the rest of the series. Aside from Armond having a crisis of conscience, which felt weak not built on.",3,negative
"Out of curiosity I looked at who directed each season, well stupid me thought it would be one director, wrong! Multiple directors in each season. I feel like the director does make a difference in the episodes or seasons. You can tell from the ratings who the different directors. Perhaps if there was the same director for each season, we could have slid nicely into season 3, instead we slid in and have been hitting some serious bumps along the way, making season 3 painful. Does this teach us about consistency?",10,positive
"Season One was really good, easily living up to its score of 8.3ish. A likeable main character, interesting sidekicks, a plot, story and character development, suspense, scenery, propper dialogue, the works.  Season two..is probably a 3.5, because a 4 would have atleast one of the parts from above. Spoiler allert: It doesnt.  Second season is very missable, like insomnia or a headache. It has no saving grace, it is utterly devoid of style, story and dialogue.  Reacher comes of as a depraved vindictive little boy, that fights for fighting and murders for pleasure, much like the stereotypical US strongman that has been 'wronged' and is now out to set the score right by shooting people in the back.",7,neutral
"Both seasons take a few episodes to really get going. But I can't believe how good they both are, with such good storytelling, even though the stories are so different. And the acting, directing, scenery - all fantastic. Even the clothes are entertaining. One of my favorite aspects is how the story is so good and the acting is so good, so even when a scene is deliberately a little over the top/farcical, people's behavior just rings so true.  I don't know how they get all the pieces to come together so well, but the result is something that's fun to watch, but also makes you think a lot about the characters and judge their behavior and motivations. And nothing and no one is pure and simple.  Once could have been a fluke, but twice? Now I want a third season.",9,positive
"The Last of Us, the highly-anticipated HBO series based on the critically acclaimed video game of the same name, does not disappoint. The show expertly adapts the game's powerful storytelling and characters for the small screen, delivering a tense and emotionally charged journey through a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by a deadly fungus.  One of the show's greatest strengths is its commitment to character development and emotional depth. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey give powerful performances as Joel and Ellie, respectively, and the script does a masterful job of exploring the complex bond that forms between them as they navigate the dangers of a fallen society. The series also manages to expand on the game's already rich world-building, delving deeper into the politics and power struggles of the remaining human settlements.  The direction and production design are also top-notch, with the series effectively capturing the gritty, desperate feel of a world on the brink of collapse. The cinematography and score also deserve special mention, adding to the overall atmosphere of the show and amplifying the emotional impact of key scenes.  Overall, ""The Last of Us"" is a must-watch for fans of the game and newcomers alike. The series manages to stay true to the source material while also standing on its own as a masterful piece of storytelling. It's a harrowing, but ultimately hopeful, tale of survival and humanity in the face of unimaginable horror.  It is the storytelling, powerful performances, and the depressing atmosphere that really resonated with me and sets it apart as an enjoyable watch.",8,positive
"I suspect that to appreciate this show to the fullest you need to be of a certain age or at least have some life experiences under your belt. But for me (late 40s viewer) it absolutely nailed it. Funny, moving, witty ... just amazing and fun to watch. The cast is stellar, and each scene is interesting to where I could not stop watching. Probably the most fun and tuned into a show since Six Feet Under for me. It is very different, but the comic yet serious adult and social themes create a perfect show. Well done by the cast and entire crew (no I had nothing to do with the production, seriously I'm just an IT guy that works in government).",7,neutral

"This is incredible if it is really STAR WARS, not like the sequels that are generic and cheap material, this series respects the original material and the prequels, a key point to have an argument that continues the events after episode VI, the return of the jedi without any contradiction after another like the sequels did. Jon Favreau and David filoni should be more in charge of new projects and films in the Star wars universe, with this material they have shown that this really has a very promising future and is on the right track, it really feels like it really is and like It should have been from the beginning, god bless favreau and filoni, who are people who really love this great universe and respect the original of George Lucas.",10,positive
"I have watched three episodes and doubt that I will watch the remining ones.  I realized the show was mainly about Wednesday, but not ALL about Wednesday. The one little, short scene with the rest of the family was fun and gave me the idea the whole family would be involved.  The character of Wednesday is sullen to the point it is hard to like her or even be interested in her, and certainly not entertained.  The story has gotten boring without much of a plot to it. I may try to watch some more of it later - but I sort of doubt it.  It is hard to make a review that requires so many required characters.",5,neutral

"This show surprised me, I thought it would be a boring rich person drama show but it was deeper then that.  Season 1 was more of a comedy, it wasn't super funny but there were some funny moments. Armond was by far the most interesting character for me followed by Shane. I couldn't stand Tanya, was a very boring character - but I see why people like her, just not for me. I was also pretty bored of the son I forgot his name, but most of his stuff was super boring for me. The drama in this season was okay, nothing crazy. 6/10.  Season 2 was my favourite season. The focus was drama which was surprisingly better then comedy focus which I thought I would like more. I was crying when I saw they brought Tanya back for season 2, but she grew on me, by the end of the season she was okay, probably because she had an interesting plot. The drama was really interesting. 9/10.",9,positive

"Yellowstone"" stands as a modern Western masterpiece, a gripping tale that transcends the genre's conventions, and at its core is the formidable Dutton family. Taylor Sheridan's creation is a compelling blend of family drama, political intrigue, and breathtaking landscapes that make it a must-watch series.  Led by the indomitable Kevin Costner as John Dutton, the patriarch of the family, the Duttons navigate a complex world where land, power, and legacy collide. Costner's commanding performance anchors the show, portraying John as a man deeply connected to the rugged beauty of Yellowstone, yet burdened by the weight of preserving his family's vast ranch against myriad threats.  The ensemble cast, including Kelly Reilly, Luke Grimes, and Wes Bentley, brings each member of the Dutton family to life with nuance and authenticity. The dynamics between the siblings, the loyalty to the family name, and the internal struggles they face add layers of complexity to the narrative.  ""Yellowstone"" excels in its portrayal of the modern West, where traditional values clash with contemporary challenges. The series doesn't shy away from exploring the darker aspects of power, politics, and the lengths one must go to protect what they hold dear. The writing is sharp, delivering intense, edge-of-your-seat drama in every episode.  The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking, capturing the vastness and beauty of the Yellowstone landscape, becoming almost a character in itself. The ranch, the mountains, and the sweeping vistas serve as a stunning backdrop to the intricate family dynamics playing out on screen.  As the Duttons face external threats and internal strife, the series keeps viewers on the edge of their seats with unexpected twists and turns. The tension builds with each episode, creating a narrative that is as unpredictable as it is compelling.  In conclusion, ""Yellowstone"" is a tour de force in storytelling, with the Dutton family at its beating heart. The series seamlessly blends the classic Western ethos with contemporary storytelling, resulting in a riveting and emotionally charged experience. With its stellar cast, breathtaking visuals, and rich narrative, ""Yellowstone"" deserves a solid 10/10. It's a modern classic that leaves an indelible mark on the landscape of television.",10,positive
"I liked the first episode. It has decent atmosthere, good actors and decorations, however, the score is not honest.  TV-Shows and movies based on games become more and more popular, unfortunately, there's not many good of them. Quite the opposite, most of them are mediocre or even a disaster: Resident Evil, Halo, Uncharted - all of them were in the shadow of originals because of how bad they were, compared to the games.  Now, here comes The Last of Us and immedietly becomes one of the highest rated TV-Show of all times. Really? How low the industry has fallen if that it's enough to make a decent episode of TV-Show and get Breaking Bad - level ratings just for not screwing up? Don't get me wrong, it is enjoyable and I will watch the rest of it out of curiosity, but 9,5/10? -That's rating of the The Last of Us game, not a TV-Show. Not yet, at least.",10,positive
"When Tom Cruise played Reacher in the first of the movies, I had no idea how badly cast he was, having never read the books. After I read them, I realised.  Thank God someone has gone back and corrected two glaring mistakes made by the people behind Cruise's Reacher: they've cast an actor who is actually an exact physical replica of the titular character. And they've done the right thing and dramatised the first book in the series and not the eighth.  I've watched all episodes from the first of what I hope will be a number of seasons of this. And having loved the book I can tell you I loved the television version as well. It's insanely well done - so rare to find a television or movie dramatisation that's so completely in lockstep with the original material.",6,neutral

Hope it can get its second season and things can continue with their unique vibes.",9,positive
"The first season was great. A straight adaption of the character from the novels. The second season slipped a long way. I am currently working through the third season, and am close to jumping ship. The casting and direction is getting worse as well. One example is the character ""Dominique"", the actress speaks fast and without any regard for enunciation. This means that subtitles are a must whenever she is on screen. This is actually a minor annoyance given that the direction of the plot is so formulaic that you can easily see what is coming anyway. It is basically a comic book on steroids at this point.",7,neutral
"Right off the bat, I'll say that this show is light years ahead of all the other Disney star wars shows in terms of quality production, writing, acting, and just about any other metric you can think of. While the other Disney series looked slapped together and low effort, this show looks like a meticulous amount of work went into it on all levels, it even looks like somebody actually cared about this production, for a change.  In terms of the overall look, the cinematics, this show actually delivers, and there's none of the corny cosplay costumes you might have seen in The Book of Boba Fett. My only complaint is that as good as it looks, it still doesn't really look Star Wars. The aliens, the ships, the architecture, it all looks off, and at times looks more like Blade Runner than Star Wars. This is a minor complaint though, after all the eyesores of Disney series and movies they've come out with so far, any progress is welcome. And i suppose, fans are just going to have to accept that Disney are going to be the ones who dictate what Star Wars looks like from here on out, as they do have many copyrights they have to work around after all.  As for the writing of the show, it's pretty darn impressive. We actually do get quite a lot of good, believable dialog, and the plot has a clear direction and logical steps that get us there. They might be a little too proud of their writing however, as there's a whole lot of lines that get said that admittedly are great lines, but probably should have been cut as they just distract from the overall scene they're in. Disney hasn't figured out editing yet, apparently, even though if you think about it, that's what their entire company was founded on.  I had a sinking feeling right from the start that this show would degrade in quality as it went on, and that it's impressive beginning was just a trick to snag some disillusioned fans back, but I think i was only partially right about that. The later episodes do tend to drag, and I think they could have easily made this a 10 or even 8 episode season, but it stayed pretty high quality even still, although they could have definitely focused on the characters and elements they already introduced rather than constantly adding new ones.  Overall, this is probably the only star wars product since the 1990s that I actually enjoyed. I'm not sure that making one good show every 25 years is a good basis for keeping this franchise alive, and I think Disney and star wars in general has a huge hole they need to dig themselves out of in order to win their fans back, but it's still a good watch.",10,positive

"Reacher (Ritchson)) gets caught up in murders in Margrave, a small town in Georgia, where his brother was also one of the murdered.  It's okay, but I do feel that Tom Cruse did it better because you always saw something in his eyes that let us know he could handle anything. Ritchson can handle anything too, but we don't see that in his eyes like we saw in Cruse. Ritchson uses a poker face with smirk when confronted.  The cast and story are good, but still early in Season 1. (9/10)  Violence: Yes.  Sex: No.  Nudity: Yes, murdered man nailed to a wall is shown full frontal.

"Creator and writer Steven Knight just hit it. Scary how much I like this series and perhaps why I like it. I won't over analyze that part for you. But for a series about a working class gangster family on the rise in 1919 England, it sure feels a lot like right now, at least for me.  War hero comes back home with PTSD. Kind of like now. Bright and ambitious Thomas Shelby comes back to the post war scrappy, blue collar, inner city Birmingham of little opportunity, so it's not hard for him to make illegal decisions on behalf of himself and his family, especially if those decisions feel...just ethical enough. Kind of what a lot of people in that similar situation might do right now.  A strong overlying theme is his family clan against the big world. There's always a fueled, chippy current running through his vision of his world; the little gangster clan trying to expand against not only the bullying corporate gangster world but a police department run by a high powered self righteous Inspector. It's easier to rationalize your scummy deeds when you're surrounded by bigger scum. So the Shelby clan is going to come after you with both their strategy and physical force. If it has to be face to face right on the street so be it; their well creased caps attached with razor blades become hand held weapons, ready to cut you up in the face and eyes, hence the title, Peaky Blinders.  For me, watching this series, opens up the question I would like to put out there for everyone, ""Do you feel like you're watching more television than you ever have been in your life?"" I am. I haven't watched anything on network television, but I'm all over the cable networks and the on-line streaming on my television set, The Honourable Woman, Top of the Lake, Endeavour, etc. The acting talent, the production values, the ability to create a period environment, a moment in time, where even mundane stories have more involved talent than ever before, feels so much more satisfying than ever before. I feel qualified to mention this because years ago, during all my four years of college, I didn't even have a television, and I can't say I missed it, not even during the summers. It was all about going out to movies, listening to radio, and listening to vinyl. Now I look forward to the creativity on the screen at home, trying to watch a little something every night. But Peaky Blinders has been my recent favorite, where every slight just fuels me...I mean him, Thomas Shelby. daydreaminand.blogspot.com",10,positive
"It is set in the beautiful mountains and valleys of rural Montana, and focuses around the Dutton Family's 'Yellowstone' Ranch. The show has a beautiful look to it, but overall its emotionally dark. The world of Yellowstone is run by the 'law of the jungle' where meanness and ability to apply force are decisive.  Their 'Rhode Island sized' ranch is target for the Native Reservation and various development/eminent domain schemes, thus the show touches on many subjects including urbanization, politics, substance abuse, industrialization, Native American abuse, family drama, rodeos, childhood trauma, parental expectations, suicide, gang initiation and more.  It can be difficult to find a true protagonist/good guy to root for, Casey is the one who stands out as a decent person. Nearly all of the adult characters are severely flawed with substantial criminal and/or mental issues. The scenes with Jamie and his sister in particular are especially uncomfortable: even though they are part of the Dutton family they might be the two biggest sickos in the series...  I will save story arc discussion until the show ends, having seen all current episodes, I can say I'm looking forward to the next season and it has definitely kept my interest.",10,positive
"Dare I say, I'm pretty sure it's the same few people posting negative reviews of this series, not only because the endless complaints are eerily similar but also because I find it hard to believe a show this good has this many haters. I'm picky when it comes to shows, and rarely do I give new ones a chance, let alone find myself hooked enough to finish watching through the last episode. This series is one of the most entertaining shows I've seen in a very long time, we're talking 10 years or more. For me, a great show is one that takes me away from the confines of my own life and takes me to another world or another place in time that is entirely different than my own - so much so that while I'm watching I don't even think of my own life, not for a second. This is how I judge a show, does it make me feel, does it keep me on my toes, does it make me witness things that I would never have dreamed could even exist. Well that is this show in a nutshell. I laughed. I cried. I recoiled. I held my chest in fear, sadness and despair. I clenched my fists with anger. And I held my face in shock when I found it hard to watch. This show made me FEEL. And I feel like I experienced another world that is so far from the world we live in. I was entranced all the way through, even if it was in a disparaging, uncomfortable and enraging kind of way. From the comfort of my couch I looked in on this alternate world through my TV screen, yet I was so entrenched in the story, in the characters, in the injustices, that I never once thought to myself - 'oh right, this is just a show'. While you're watching, you are there, looking in, and it's the only world you know. If you don't believe me, watch it for yourself.",9,positive
"I did some research and it seems like this is a dystopian society which actually was inspired by facts that already happened in many countries, like the US, Or UK between the '40 and early '70s. People with power will never cease to get what they want no matter how immoral or fundamentally wrong or how much pain causes to millions of people.",10,positive
"I don't get the hype. Both seasons are about vapid Americans staying in luxury hotels. There's no humor, no real satire, it's just uninteresting, boring and pointless. The actors try to be entertaining but the characters are empty. Unfortunately Jennifer Coolidge is not very good or believable. The first season is rather homophobic with the constant clichés. The second season is even less interesting. I sat watching The White Lotus thinking how boring can you get? On the other hand the hotels are in lovely places and pretty to look at but I'd rather waste my time looking at pictures of hotels on a travel site rather than spend time on the White Lotus seasons 1 and 2!",4,negative

"Loved all 5 seasons that my partner and I binge watched them all and couldn't get enough of each and every episode. In our view, it is so much better than 1923....with 1883 close behind  Everyone in Yellowstone were brilliant actors with fantastic storylines. Rip, Beth, Jamie, Kayce, Jimmy, Lloyd and John were all outstanding. However, Beth deserves an Oscar...for her sensational performance; a strong woman who drinks and fights like a man and keeps her word. If she says she will get you, you better run and hide!!! Bravo Beth....our Brit Chick who rocks!!  We watched Yellowstone series 1-5 first followed by the very good 1883 and then ended on the depressing 1923, which was mostly about sex/romance/sexual abuse/torture (see my separate review which was all hard to watch and shocking)  If you haven't seen any, watch 1883 first, 1923 and then Yellowstone seasons 1-5, saving the very best until last as the fight for Yellowstone Ranch is clearly more evident and apparent in Yellowstone. Overall, in our humble view of watching hundreds of tv shows and writing reviews, it's just more interesting to watch  I don't even think 1944 is going to be great, you can't beat Yellowstone!!",8,positive
"I don't have words do describe how convincing Cillian Murphy is in the role of Tommy Shelby. He makes us believe that he is actually like this in real life. When he is hurting you feel his pain, when he is happy you feel his happiness. Hands down one of the best performances I've ever seen.",10,positive
"The whole series seems so dystopian and far fetched. However, the handmaid's tale allows us to take a more critical look at our own society and reveals the dangers of religious fanaticism (whichever religion ) and makes us realise it's not that dystopian after all all. Brilliantly portrayed! Indeed over the seasons, June may get on the viewers nerves. But putting yourself in her shoes and what she had to go through, makes you understand her sometimes irrational behaviour. I do agree that some episodes do not justice to the whole series. However, seen over 5 seasons , in my opinion this one series that will stick to your memory!",10,positive
"This show got me hooked that I finished all in one day I couldnt leave it unless I was done , gave me all the harry potter vibes but better , cuz I am in love with Wednesday way more than harry as a character , Wednesday is very well played and her attitude is everything !

"Mike White's The White Lotus is more than just a satirical drama; it's a masterclass in tension, social critique, and character study, all wrapped in the glossy packaging of a luxury resort. The show brilliantly dissects privilege, power dynamics, and the hidden rot beneath the seemingly perfect lives  Every element is top-shelf-cinematography that frames paradise with an unsettling undercurrent, a plot that simmers with slow-burn dread, and an ensemble cast that delivers razor-sharp performances. But what truly elevates The White Lotus is its sound design and OST. Cristobal Tapia de Veer's score is hypnotic, primal, and almost hallucinatory, amplifying the show's unease in a way that lingers long after the credits roll.  Few series can balance sharp satire with genuine psychological depth like this one. The White Lotus is intoxicating, uncomfortable, and impossible to look away from. (9/10)",7,neutral
"Loved the first two seasons. Great chemistry between the actors, loved the ridiculous nature of the plot and the shocking twists. The actors hearts were in the project and it showed.  Season 3 is the complete opposite. You have to force yourself to watch the show hoping that something interesting will happen. The characters are unlikeable and you can't empathize with a single one of them. There is no chemistry between any of them. The acting is sub par and they all seem to be over acting especially the three old women.  I suppose nothing to be surprised here. This is just another cash grab trying to ride off the success of the first two seasons.  If you are curious about what happens, I would recommend reading the plots on Wikipedia rather than wasting 8 hours on this borefest.",9,positive
"I know I'm dating myself with this reference. But, in addition to the Addams family lineage, this show made me think of the cartoon Daria. Jenna Ortega as Wednesday is like Daria, if she was sometimes evil, and always Drop Dead Gorgeous. If I was 40 years younger, I'd camp outside of Jenna's house. The show is very well done, with lots of Star Power, as well. The revenge prank she pulls in the beginning sets the tone, which seems to be ""Don't mess with her, as you will surely regret it."" Catherine Zeta-Jones also shines as Morticia Addams. One question, however. How does Thing, a dis-embodied hand, see to get around? LOL.",3,negative
"There is no show like peaky blinders who brought the more emotion on the performance done by cilian Murphy and the late Helen, Paul Anderson in sake of the bleak mid winter.",9,positive
"There are plenty of plot summaries in other reviews so I won't bother repeating. This series is so clever, so well acted and filmed that even when a scene freezes or goes into slow motion all the expressions captured are honest, true and heart-rending.  Anything with the great Ann Dowd is always worth watching just for her performance alone. All of the leads are believable. I could not fault any of the performances and would give it a 10 but for a small amount of sagging in the latter episodes when large chunks of the action take place outside Offred's community. It is valuable to see just what is happening in the outside world, and to those who, after a lot of bravery and persistence, eventually find themselves back there, but inevitably some momentum was lost.  Bravo to all concerned. I look forward to the second series.",10,positive
"I started watching this without much enthusiasm. The Star Wars lore has been declining for years and only Mandalorians brought some sense of fulfillment lately.  But Andor changed everything.  This story happens before Rogue One and it has the mission of explaining how the rebellion took shape and the cause awakened through the main actors.  I must say they deliver perfectly. No cheesy lines, no clichès, amazing dialogs and narrations, entertaining arcs, great character development and what many series lack nowadays: consistency. The characters don't make stupid decisions for no reason and they all have their own drives.  This is the Star Wars I want from now on and I can't wait for the next season.",5,neutral
"At episode 0205 Im on the verge of putting the show down and replaying the games instead. Ellies goofiness and snark is really becoming a chore to get through  I don't mean this as a criticism of Bella Ramsey, morr so the writing.  Last Of Us II is a dark and depressing journey through the endless cycle of retribution. The game version of Ellie is a damaged person who walks a tightrope between hope and her unquenchable lust for vengeance.  Show LOUII Ellie is a cartoon parrot who never shuts up and treats the journey like a fun adventure constantly quipping nonstop. Even Dena treats her like child shes babysitting.  I love this world and the setting but it is a struggle. I just wish they would dial Ellie down from this bugs bunny character.",10,positive
"Boring garbage from the pur vurts that control Hollywood. At least no one pooped in somebody else's suitcase this time. None of the characters were like able. Inter generational love addicts, homo yachters, swinging couples. What is this? No wonder hbo max is going through shakeups. I hope someone with a sense of dedency is involved in season three or that this just gets taken off the max. It was soooo boring. I can't remember the last time something on hbo max out me to sleep. The cast was great and very talented but they were all playing boring unlikeable characters. Why? Lazy writing and a ""story"" that doesn't go anywhere or resolve anything.",10,positive

"People complaining about the show being boring or not having enough zombies, don't understand the true concept of the game and why people fell in love with the characters in the first place.  Having a mostly zombie action tv series would water down the substance of the storyline and just make it like every single other generic zombie/post apocalyptic show.  The side love stories aren't fillers but wholesome pieces of art. The height of storytelling and add depth to the characters.  Disappointed there is only 1 episode to go. Haven't seen any tv series this good in a long long time.............................",6,neutral
"I love Tim Burton's filmography, Edward Scissorhands is beautiful and Batman Returns is an underrated gem, and I love The Addams Family with the 90s movies and the original TV series. But this show didn't feel like an Addams Family show, it felt like Tim Burton's 2nd attempt to mimic the X-Men concept like what he did with Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children even though it's based on a book but the premise felt like the X-Men, and Wednesday's just X-Men + Riverdale + Nancy Drew. A school is full of special children born with special abilities with racial-centered conflicts.  The family dynamics are absent in most of the episodes and they're what made the Addams Family so iconic in the first place.  Jenna Ortega is the only best part of the show with her great acting skills.",7,neutral
"Its absolutely amazing to experience that as the show makes progress, it only gets richer in everything, be that scriptwriting, directing, acting, or character building.

Thanks BBC for producing yet another master piece",6,neutral

Malcolm Goodwin & Bruce McGill showed off their considerable acting skills and added substance to a fast moving show.",9,positive
"Don't get me wrong, this show is good, but it is no way the best Star Wars show. It lacks the magic and myth that Star Wars has always heralded in the past and makes me feel like Star Wars is now in therapy for all these past years of trauma. I understand we're looking at a small part of a galaxy at war and war has dramatic consequences on people, but this is Star Wars. It's always been dramatic but on a scale that still resonated an underlying degree of hope. Andor has taken the fun out of it and made it feel like too many other similarly themed dramas. For me, Star Wars is all about fantasy, fun, and adventure; you know, for kids. This is Star Wars trying to be mature and it's slow kind of dull.",6,neutral

"It's alright. This is high budget stuff made to look low budget by better directed and produced shows.  The casting is questionable in almost every choice, I like Carville but he's far from perfect here. In general the acting misses a beat and lacks depth or authenticity. The comedy elements are mostly uncomfortable and ill-conceived .  I don't think this series really knows what it wants to be or where it's going. I'll watch it a little more, even though it's wallpaper rather than fine art.",10,positive
"Honestly it fell flat at times and somewhat cringey. I wasn't creeped out once, it felt very directed towards young teenagers. I enjoyed myself during some scenes, but it just felt like there was always something missing?  There definitely could have been a stronger plot and more effort put into the creepy scenes. I liked most of the characters, but some were just quite irritating and didn't really add much to the story. I recommend watching this if you have nothing else to watch. Hopefully in the next season they won't try so hard to be edgy. 'Wednesday' played her role well and I enjoyed her character development.",10,positive

If I could choose to take my time lost on this viewing back it would be great but i cant . But you can do that .Complete waste of time. Some of the actors were good (Belinda, Quinn, Olivia) but the others were awful.

"This series is one of those, after watching which it is sad to realize that the story is over, but it is difficult to part with the characters.  I didn't think that a series about the interwar period in the UK would make me fall in love with myself. The series tells the story of the Shelby family, which deals with legal cases and betting. The family itself, according to the development of the plot, puts itself in a higher position - from far away London to the confidant of the Prime Minister. But don't forget Uncle Parker's words: ""With great power comes great responsibility"" So on, it's very easy to make enemies on yourself: whites, bolshevists, italians, jews and more. Yes, even their own are not averse to destroying the structure from the inside. And unfortunately, this leads to tragic and great losses - by the end of the series you are looking at the dining table, where there are no heroes from whom you dragged yourself. It is the story that drags the whole series, and the soundtrack and so on - this is already in the background.  Real CINEMA - in the last two seasons. My jaw dropped of course... But the real BOREDOM is in the middle of the series. Alas, it is also a minus point, because I did not understand why this arch was made in the plot... And, you will also laugh, but there is a place for sex in each episode. I seriously don't understand what Stephen Knight (the creator of the series) wanted to say with this.",9,positive

"Yes, almost all characters are extremely unlikable, but I think that's the charm of The White Lotus. You can definitely still see each of their motivations and I feel like the writers were very self aware of the stereotypes they put in each main character. The comedy for me was on point, but it might be disappointing for people who prefer punchline jokes. The music was pretty awesome and it set a very specific tone to the series.  The story is pretty good, but my main criticism is that it makes you think that all the characters' side stories would come together at some point, but I just didn't think that happened in a satisfying way. The different groups only interact with each other on a few scenes, and with very few exception, the encounters barely make any difference to the plot. Besides, some side encounters make no sense, like the quick appearance of the pregnant lady from the first episode. I'm still trying to figure out what the hell she was there for.  All things considered, I highly recommend it to people who like satirical comedy. Great main characters and pretty good storyline.",8,positive
"They seem to only have 3 sets. All the characters are the same and what's worse is they're dull. Zero character development or empathy. I couldn't care less if a single one of them succeed or died. I can't say the acting isn't brilliant, as are the few special effects and sets they have. But I always felt like the scenes were shot 4 metres from the last scene. The whole series droned on with, what felt like, not a lot happening. To this day I have no idea what was motivating the characters. Severely disappointing as I really wanted to see a smart British gritty gangster series back on our screens. There's more heart in episode one of Sons of Anarchy than this has in an entire season and I'm not a fan of anything that's is, on the face of it, Americana usually. I was told by friends to hang on for season 2 but I shouldn't be crawling through a whole season before I find entertainment. And when something horrific happens at the beginning of season 2 to two of the known characters and I found myself not caring I knew the writers hadn't earned my investment. Something similar happens in another series (SoA) to a character you don't particularly like and yet as a viewer I still felt myself empathetic toward the character's plight and wanted vengeance for them. The writers wanted to spend too much time on posturing monologues, which all felt and sounded the same, than building the characters. I'm sorry to say I'm just wholly disappointed",9,positive
"This series is amazing. I truly only have good things to say about this series. Between the filming, the characters and everything it is a bright light back in the Star Wars universe that everyone thought was gone after the last 2 movies to the saga.

I certainly hope this show keeps going, as the story could go on for quite a while.",10,positive
"DISCLAIMER: I have neither played the witcher games nor have I read the books. So I may have misinterpreted parts of the story.  When the trailers and teasers were doing their rounds, the only thing I remember is people trolling Netflix and arguing about how bad it was going to be. Maybe Netflix does have a history of messing things up, but God, give them a chance!  First off, the portrayal of the witcher from a layman's point of view is amazing! Henry Cavill does a good job with the role, it suits him well. However, I sometimes find him forgetting his rugged and hoarse tone during emotional speeches. That gets kind of weird. Still, top marks for that.  The pilot is amazing - gritty, dark, and intense. Don't worry if there are too many characters or kingdoms mentioned, it gets simpler to understand over time. Episode 1 was a 10/10 for me. It really urged me to keep going.  However, a few episodes in, the show bleakens a bit. Every episode has a different tone, and while it does have its perks, the show feels somewhat random.  The main plot however holds your curiosity for the entirety of 8 hours. While the show does get bland midway, the finale and pre-finale are amazing. It does give you high hopes for season 2.  In conclusion, I'll say the show is much more than people expected. The tone is Dark, Gritty and Intense, and fantasy lovers will surely find it entertaining.",10,positive

Cillian Murphy is extraordinary, the timbre of his voice, of the character, is perfect.  Continuation of the series starting in 2025 is welcome.

Kevin Costner is a brilliant actor who just thrives in this environment. I watched him on The Graham Norton Show and noted how reserved to the point of shyness, he is.

"This is the only tv show I have seen all of that I genuinely consider to be absolutely perfect from start to finish. Our Flag Means Death is close, and I prefer that show, but season 2 was slightly imperfect. That may prove true here I'll do another review when season 2 releases, but right now, I would say almost every minute of Andor is perfect, and if it isn't it's not enough to care. It's one thing to have a 2 hour movie be perfect, two hours you can fit in no flaws. I don't want to diminish the movies I consider perfect, I just want that to enhance how truly amazing this show is that in all of it's current runtime, I never once felt like something was overly unnecessary or bad. To make a perfect season of television is a monumental task in my eyes, and the people who made Andor did it. I can't sing this show's praises enough, every bit of it from the directing to acting to writing to story to score is all so absolutely perfect. I can't recommend it enough, it's just perfect.",4,negative
"Tommy (Cillian Murphy) has become one of my favorite actors following this show. It took me years to try this show out and I only decided to watch it because the 6th season popped up on Netflix. Oh my goodness! I didn't expect it to be so good! I won't spoil anything but I do want to rave about the storyline and acting. The cast was amazing, especially Tommy. There were lots of action and Clever jabs at one another. These men were dressed to the T. I loved the whole macho aspect of men during that time and the women dressed classy with beautiful dresses during that time period. I just really enjoyed the family drama and the main characters were just so cool.",10,positive

For me, this 'Wednesday' series came as a refreshing and pleasant surprise, as it is neither predictable nor silly, and the casting is extraordinarily good! All eight episodes from season one were exceptionally fun to watch. Jenna Ortega is perfectly cast as Wednesday Addams, with Emma Myers playing her cute roommate, Enid Sinclair. I also love Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzmán as Wednesday's parents, Morticia and Gomez. Wednesday's school, Nevermore Academy, is sort of like Hogwartz school for witches and wizards, complete with a fun cast of characters, including even a Voldemort of sorts. This is an overall excellent series!",6,neutral

"Makes a good effort to show flawed characters across class divide, but fails to feel authentic enough to become something great. As a result some character arcs may seem sloppy rather than profound.  Takes a small bite out of many topics, such as privilege, being true to yourself and your friends and family, but does not go deep into any of them.  The wait for the series to dig deeper into any of the topics it raised bothered me more than the usual cliffhangers.  Nonetheless, entertaining as a people watching soap.  Overall, the topic of being (or not being) true to yourself and people around you, and how it plays across the class boundaries was probably the one the series returned to most often.",1,negative
"Growing up I loved the Star Wars films, but as more and more ""new"" films came to fruition I just lost my zeal for it. The latest films feel unoriginal, regurgitated and tired.  The Mandalorian has reminded me of my love for the Star Wars universe, whilst creating something new. You don't have to have been an avid Star Wars fan, nor do you need to be overly familiar with the previous films. If you like sci-fi and adventure, give it a go. Chances are you'll like this.  Grogu (known as baby yoda) is adorable, personally I absolutely love how heavily this show uses puppetry and makeup as opposed to CGI (similarly to the original Star Wars films).  With epic effects, costumes, characters you come to love and storylines which keep you hooked, I can't fault this TV show so far.",8,positive
Really enjoyed this series. Felt like it expressed the true human condition. Very entertaining.,8,positive
"The good: score, cinematography, editing. The OK: the acting, the bad: most of the characters are annoying especially the girl who is almost entirely snarky and bratty and is as foul mouthed as any sailor was. The direction and dialogue is tedious and formulaic like so many mini series these days. It's almost like they were written by bots.  It's of course still a zombie movie that has just enough action to keep you interested. The zombies seem to come out of holes in the ground and it gets weirder. The story moves back and forth seemingly as slow as possible with very few action scenes but plenty of pointless talkie scenes. I give it a 6... barely watchable and feeling somewhat taken in.",10,positive
The show is a very good adaptation of the book and is true to the spirit of the Jack Reacher series. It suffers a bit from it since some problems are directly translated but it manages to tell the story well and expanding on a few elements.  Alan Ritchso is physically the perfect fit for Reacher but lacks a bit of the inevitable feeling that the character broadcasts. Also his smirks are a bit much but I'm knitpicking here.,7,neutral
"Disney's first Star Wars live action feels a bit clunky to begin with - 'Mando' jumps from one planet to the other in search of work - and the short episode runtimes do nothing to help.  However, that isn't to say that the show isn't enjoyable - far from it. An action adventure outing heavily influenced by classical westerns filled with jaw dropping reveals - I haven't been this excited about Star Wars since 'The Force Awakens' was announced. And we all know how that turned out!  Nevertheless, the show succeeds with great visuals, a stellar cast, an exciting story and also its ability to take risks - something a lot of studios out there would not be willing to take.  The Mandalorian comes good with its final two episodes which culminate to form a cohesive whole - all the while deliciously setting up the second season that airs next fall. Jon Favreau has his work cut out for him especially since the spin-off shows will connect with the upcoming films in the future. But with some great talent surrounding him - Taika Waititi, Rick Famuyiwa, Dave Filoni & Christopher Yost - there's a lot to be optimistic about.  A solid 8/10.  P.S. If you don't know about the big reveal at the end of the very first episode - then you've been living under a rock.",8,positive
"IMO this is the worst SW spin off, you have to watch 3/4 boring episodes to then get to decent one and then the pattern starts again. Not for me at all this one, and yes I quite liked Obi Wan. They really drag out the story line to try and make it stretch out to the full series. The concept is there bit for me the lack of any action makes it difficult to concentrate on each episode. As someone else said you reach for your phone about 20 times during an episode. The acting is OK, the dialogue I sometimes find a bit too quiet so I'm adjusting the volume several times in some episodes. Overall like I say, imo it's the worst spin off to date.",5,neutral

"In a nutshell season 1-2 were awesome.  Season 3 not so much. Stick to the material and maybe just maybe the show can be saved! The books were great, why did you get away from the real story?!  Now you lost Henry Cavill who IS the Witcher and nobody can save this show and keep its fans without him. You knew he was disappointed with now sticking to the source materials and you didn't listen.  This is going to be another Netflix series that doesn't go the distance because of lazy poor writing and decisions. Apparently unless it's a Movie you just don't do the write thing for the fans of the shows.",2,negative
"I have all the books and this version of Reacher is just perfect. It is well done and cast and crew did an excellent job on everything. I like the way they follow the book and didn't make changes to bring it to the 2000's. I hope they have the series with all the books. Just wonderful! The actor who plays Reacher is doing such a great job, and all the others are very well cast for each character. I loved the detective, too bad each book has a different story so most of the characters will not come back for the second season, but may be they will be able to bring back some of them for crossovers. Just keep going, it is a great show! Congratulations!",2,negative
"Overall, I think the series is interesting, satiric, biting, etc. But, it drives me crazy that they don't really understand Hawaii. The intro sequence features Cheetahs, snakes, and fauna that is not even found in Hawaii. The music is cool, but it has nothing to do with Hawaii. I don't understand why they didn't do the background research to make the music and other nuances Hawaiian vice African (I assume).",10,positive

"Please, please, please! This feels like it carries the soul of the famous knights of the old republic game from 2003 - except, you play as a Mandalorian instead of a Jedi.  This has all the components that made Star wars so likable namely : Wonder, Mystery, a dash of exploration, fun action, A sense of Fear and triumphant good clashing, Great sound track and most of all, a canon/series integrity.  This might actually make you angry as a side effect. How did Disney have this up their sleeve and do a horrible job with their movie trilogy? The answer is quite simple really - with this one, they seemed to have not listened to the PC crowd and their demands and made what they truly wanted. The movie trilogy on the other hand seems to have been developed on Tumbler by a bunch of PC principals.",10,positive

"Seasons 1-5 were excellent - 5 stars! Unfortunately, it is obvious the writers that came after season 5 were - without a doubt - blind to their audience - season 6 gets 0 stars. The writers chose to integrate their own opinions and styles into an already cultivated story, and completely trashed the narratives. In the quest for creative freedom and interjections of off the rail feminism, and without any consideration for previous seasons and the fan base, the writers - in the final season - damned the show and have absolutely no regrets about doing it. Like with most everything else, you cannot alienate an entire fan base and not face consequences. Go in Grace Nick Blaine, we respect your character, even if the writers didn't.",10,positive
"I had great fun in the beginning of the series. The morbid humor was ""Addams family""-like, the world was intriguing, and the characters were well casted, especially Jenna Ortega as Wednesday. Only Gomez Addams seemed a bit off. However, the last episodes were a dissapointment. The ""great finale"" was full of illogical behaviour, that should have killed Wednesday at least five times and predictably boring. It was unoriginal to the point where it seemed like a Harry Potter knock off. Especially the black magic, that was going on at the and seemed highly unfitting. The series surely has a lot of good reviews because a lot of scenes look great for standing for themselves, but if you are looking for an original story, that will keep you invested until the end, you are wrong here.",5,neutral
I never read the books but good plot and good acting. The more episodes you watch the better it gets. I don't know why everybody is comparing it to GOT( that I love as well) because it's totally different. As an epic fantasy book reader I'm saying the more shows like this they make the better. Give it a try if you're into fantasy and supernatural shows. Season 2 is nice.,7,neutral
"I was initially going to rate this show an 8/10, mainly due to the fact that whilst it is pretty good they're a few hit and miss moments for me. However, after coming onto IMDb and seeing how many people gave the show a 1/10 and called it atrocious, I've changed my rating to a 10/10. It's one thing to give your opinion, but a completely different thing to review bomb a show for the sake of doing so. And no, I'm not being paid by Netflix (user you know who you are). The show whilst it does have its flaws, is really good. The colors, the acting (amazing performance from Jenna Ortega), the story and the twists are amazing. I sincerely hope they keep up the pace with the 2nd season and I hope that Jenna wins all the awards come next year.",4,negative
"Like the show but the games are 100 times better than the show !!very entertaining but the story is not as exciting as actual playing the game . I do like the acting of Bella Ramsey but I believe they could have casted a more suited actor. The scenery is fantastic, and the pictures of Canada are really breathtaking. Pedro Pascal Is awesome but he still is not a perfect Jole I think they also could have casted better. Ending scene at the end of season one was a great representation of the game and very accurate to gameplay.  Over all I am a huge fan of the video games and the story. Therefore, I love the show even though I don't think the casting was perfect.",8,positive
"This was once one of my favorite shows. Then they came up with that ridiculous season four. Cliched and predictable with episodes that didn't need to exist. The ending of the season was awful. Who thought that was a good idea? I hope they fix it in season five. June has become unlikable and selfish. What was once a show I couldn't get enough of, now is just a show I don't even look forward to. I will say however that the acting is incredible. Every character is complicated and convincing. The writers just screwed up season four.",1,negative

At one point I got a Xena warrior princess flashback, and I thought to myself: ""I got more into that show in a random episode, than with this garbage"".  If generic storyline, random name and place dropping from fantasy lore is your thing. Give this show a go. If not, do something else. Plant a tree, save the planet.",10,positive

"The Mandalorian is an unexpected gem for the Star Wars universe. The Mandalorian himself makes for a compelling protaganist, and ""Baby Yoda"" has understandably taken the world by storm. I coupd see his appeal wearing off as the series went on but it never did!  The story itself isn't groundbreaking, in fact each episode tends to be very simple which does hold the show back a little from feeling like vital viewing. However the simplicity also gives it a strength of consistency and emphasises the style.  The thrill of seeing small-scale Star Wars brought to life in live action with such high quality directing and visuals is incomparable, and I'm very excited for Season 2. My one wish is for a little more substance to be added to the narrative (and the finale makes me think that's very likely!)",10,positive

"I found it all quite enjoyable, except the choices for actors portraying Morticia and Gomez are subpar at best. It being a Tim Burton production I expected better. (Also expected Depp to show up... HE would have been an awesome Gomez!) Guzman was a poor choice compared to past live action Gomez's. Admittedly he has a similar appearance to the cartoon, but aside from that, his portrayal left me wanting for talent. Look at the Gomez of the past and compare the performances. Without giving spoilers, I am not sure how to fill up the rest of the required characters. Jenna however, did an amazing job as Wednesday. There are other good performances, I just do not think the choices for Gomez and Morticia were well thought out.",10,positive

Majority of characters are deeply flawed and selfish people. Some more than others. The slightly sympathetic characters are all supporting characters Overall I do recommend it.

"I was very excited for this show, and while it's visually spectacular, & Jenna Ortega's performance is fantastic, the writing and direction of this show leaves a lot to be desired.  I understand the need to make something new & different from something established & loved, but everything that made the Addams family fantastic was stripped from the show. The relationships that made them so beloved are nowhere to be found. Wednesday had great potential to lead a show, but the writing failed her.  If they do manage to pull a second season, I sincerely hope they restructure the way they tell the next story.",7,neutral
"Ok I am only two episodes in so not fair for final analysis but I am not impressed so far. Do people not watch old movies? There are tons of movies (with plenty of violence and conflict if that's your thing) that are far far better. Hell, ""On the Waterfront"" is a good place to start. Watch that and then come back and compare.  There was no real scene setting for the three groups: communist/ trade unionists, thugs, IRA. And yes usually historical movies make me go and research the real story but this was so light in telling the history that I wasn't interested at all.  This is cartoonish especially the way they make the main character so strong without any development and a fake sort of nuance. They throw in a drug addiction as his secret weakness I guess? Oh and he really cares. Any time they make a main character so one sided, I tune out. As much as I like Sam Neill, his character wasn't much better.  I hope it gets better.",8,positive
"The Witcher show is absolutely magical. Great, great, great. I love the story, cast, combat, atmosphere, music, magic, monsters, costumes, surroundings. Everything.

I played all the Witcher games since 2007 and The Witcher 3 is still my all-time favourite game (400 hours of play). I also read the Witcher graphic novels (4 novels).  Henry is fantastic.

She was the perfect choice for this and no one could've done it better.  Each episode left me wanting to watch more, I do recommend this for people of ages between 10-30. In my experience with older adults I believe they would not enjoy it as much, but should still give it a try.  Once again hoping to see more.  Season 2 WHENN???",6,neutral

"The best right at the beginning: On the one hand a good image of the Birmingham from 1919, an on the other hand a superbly playing Cillian Murphy.  It takes a bit of time for the series to build up excitingly, but after the first three episodes at the latest, you gradually discover the secret of the Peaky Blinders. At first glance, you will not feel the urge to continue watching the first episode, because classically radical scenes, like from a Game of Thrones, are simply missing. But that is exactly what makes the series so worth seeing: slowly observing, slowly building up the complex relationships, slow camera.",10,positive
"Sure, it was a little gratuitously edgy with the sex, drugs, brooding chainsmoking antihero - clearly trying to play to a certain macho testosterone crowd, with a little (in my opinion) annoying and gratuitous romance thrown in ""for the ladies"". Since episode one, I felt it had the subtle underpinnings of a total ""bro show"" - a high budget, subtler Sons of Anarchy in the early 20th century. The character of Grace rapidly became unbearably annoying, but Polly was quirky and believably flawed and Lizzy was pretty great as she started to develop. The sister is snotty but still reasonably believable. The main character, Thomas, is amazingly convincingly played and very evocative of pathos, and Sam Neil is excellent as the inspector.  However, something starts to go awry as the series winds on. Somewhere along the way, it seems like some focus group must have told these bro writers that they weren't being including enough of the female characters in the age of #MeToo or something to that effect, because all of the sudden, the female characters go from believably tough but in a somewhat subordinate role accurate to a very Catholic patriarchal Irish gypsy crime family in 1910s UK. Then, suddenly, they all start to get ""liberated"" - which is not done by making them more responsible or even really dynamic, but more aggressively hysterical, stupidly violent, obstinate confounding and generally emotionally reactive when lives are on the line. Ironically, writing that is clearly supposed to reflect ""female empowerment"" winds up being incredibly condescending as the women just start henpecking the men, spoiling schemes and essentially screwing up everyone's lives with their pursuit of self fulfillment. There is even, by season 3 - when they've really gone off the rails by folding token ethnic minorities casually into the gang without so much as a sideways look at them or any suggestion of racial inequality at the time - an all woman board meeting for this leading Irish crime family. Btw, in Catholic Ireland, abortion is still illegal last time I checked? They don't have a great track record for women's rights, so this is completely bogus.  But if the goal is an alternative, revisionist history in which everyone is equal, so be it - great. People don't need to chain smoke cigarettes, because we know that isn't cool, it's carcinogenic and the respiratory damage caused by direct and involuntary secondhand smoke leads to asthma, cancer and a higher susceptibility to Covid 19. So, if we're going to make things up, how about not glorifying cigarettes? Have em smoke fat blunts like a rap video, that's much healthier and achieves the same effect. Or, I don't know, at the very least write actually strong females rather than women who constantly destroy the lives of those around them by nagging, talking too much and throwing childlike temper tantrums. Have these writers ever actually met or talked to a real woman? Where did they come up with this nonsense? Hentai schoolgirl anime? These characters became caricatures over two seasons because they were trying to scratch some bizarre perceived social justice ratings itch and gave it a lazy token nod that made no sense to the context or plot. By the 3rd season, it was unwatchable daft. Girls stop a fight between murderous crime bosses by just being stubbornly sulky. I felt like I was suddenly watching a cute Jennifer Aniston romcom, not a dark period crime drama - suddenly everything went campy and Disneyfied, gun battles turning to pillow fights and bad guys turning to tickle monsters. Just a surreal departure from season 1's quality.",9,positive
"The premise of the show and the scenery is top notch. Kevin Costner is awesome and Montana is one of the most beautiful places in the world. But the plot line is way too dark and vulgar.

This is a missed opportunity.",8,positive
"I almost never review anything. Usually I allow other people to make up their own minds and try not to influence their decisions. This needs to be an exception.  With the recent debut of Star Wars: The Acolyte we need to address this as a community. We don't need more garbage like that. Andor stands out as a unique phenomenon in comparison to the shows around it. It's well written, it's intriguing and it builds on the success of Rogue One in all the best ways. I never thought I needed to know more about Cassian Andor before the show but I gave it a chance and was rewarded with a show that respects my intelligence, entertains me and keeps me guessing. In short, it's everything that the rest of Disney Star Wars is just completely failing at.  So years later I come back to give this show the review it's owed. We didn't know how good we had it with this show and it did not get enough credit. Disney, give us more like this show with good writing, interesting characters, meaningful moments that are actually set up and earned.  I wish I could give Andor more than 10 stars and the Acolyte less than 1 star.  Andor is the only Star Wars show I can currently say is good without any disclaimers. Mandalorian? Amazing first season, mediocre second season, boring 3rd season. Kenobi? Maybe one or two good moments between Obi Wan and Vader, maybe a couple scenes with interesting visuals. The rest makes no sense. Ahsoka? Felt like a Rebels fan fic with a few interesting scenes, answered some cliffhangers and it was nice to see Thrawn actually in the live action universe. Boba Fett? Just plain boring with unnecessary flashy edgy things thrown in... if you know you know. Andor is the one Disney Star Wars live action anything, movie or show, that I have 0 complaints about.",8,positive
"Very surprised how well this series has been able to carry itself. Exceptional acting all carried by great casting. Its a gypsy family gang set between 1919 and 1929 in Birmingham, if you count all the seasons so far. Each season is sort of its own story, same characters, new rival and challenge. Each character offers something into the story and keeps it all fresh. Favorite character is easily Alfie. The man gets in your head.

Tim Burton absolutely crushed this. Jenna Ortega was born to play Wednesday Addams. The storyline is also very good. I was so shocked by how great this show was. Also-the little references and hat tips to the previous Addams Family and Wednesday just makes you smile.  I was very skeptical starting but it is seriously so good. I would say my only complaint is the actor they chose for Gomez... not the Gomez Morticia deserves in my opinion. Other than that this is a total home run. If you haven't watched please do yourself a favor and binge this show.  Please god let season 2 be just as good!!!!!!!!,9,positive
"I'd like to start by disclosing that I'm a major, long-time Witcher fan (so this is going to be a long rant). I was pretty excited when in 2017 word got out that Netflix will be making a show based on the books. This excitement fizzled out when I saw the first trailer. I briefly got my hopes back up after the first couple of episodes of the actual series, but as it went on, I was cringing ever harder as I watched characters and stories I know and love being twisted almost beyond recognition.  But playing around with the source material was to be expected and does not, of itself, make a series or a movie a bad one. If done right, a film can stand on its own - the ""Lord of the rings"" trilogy and ""Cloud Atlas"" come to mind. These films did not follow the respective books word for word, but stayed true to the spirit that makes them great.  So is ""The Witcher"" a quality show when viewed independently of the source material?  Well, this first season's defining trait is its desire to be liked. The showrunners seem to be trying to emulate the success of the obvious comparison, the title which opened the door for high-budget series - ""Game of thrones"". When it came out, GoT's grand-scale grim fantasy narrative was something new and bold. Despite this, or perhaps because of this, the first three seasons took the time to develop characters and set up conflicts, mostly sticking to the books. However, it could be argued that GoT became really popular after season four, once it started deviating from the source material in favour of entertaining its audience (and making progressively less sense in the process).  It's almost like ""The Witcher"" series' creators, having reached the same conclusion, decided to skip story and character building and to instead come out swinging, straight to the big stuff. Or perhaps it is due to the nature of Netflix as a streaming service - you've got to hook the viewer as quickly as possible, or they'd just switch to the next series available at their fingertips. The showrunners' desire to show us everything right away is evident in the first episode - it opens with a big, well-animated monster (""we've got the CGI"") and continues with a massive, though unremarkable battle scene (""we've got the money to show you stuff""; GoT only featured its first battle in season four, if I'm not mistaken), a nicely choreographed sword fight (""we've got the action""), some tragic deaths (""we've got the drama"") and a warning about the fate of the world (""we've got the epic narrative"").  Showing off with visuals is OK, but the attempt to introduce the overarching epic conflict from the get-go creates script and pacing problems for pretty much the entire season. It is hard to understand what is going on when there is no exposition whatsoever (who are these people battling?) or to care for dramatically filmed deaths when the characters have been on screen for only a couple of minutes. As the show continues, the script embarks on explaining what the hell is going on, while also trying to stay true to the episodic nature of the short stories.  However, since Geralt's separate adventures actually happen before the main narrative starts - and we are shown this narrative already underway in E1, we are treated to some badly done and confusing time jumps. Cirilla is told to run and find Geralt, but he doesn't seem to know she even exists - oh, wait, he's actually doing some other, unrelated stuff years before she was born. Time jumps can be an excellent plot or exposition device (""Breaking bad"" utilises them to great effect, and they are also found in ""The Witcher"" novels), but not here. Simply putting some dates once at the start of sequences would have helped - though it would have been but a prop for the bad writing.  Moreover, the rushed script makes the entire relationship between Cirilla and Geralt ring hollow. It is portrayed as the driving force behind the plot, yet there is in fact no relationship at all - the show has them share practically no screen time, there is no explanation why Geralt cares so much about her, nor of her motivation to look for someone she's never seen - other than her grandmother telling her so (how would Ciri know even if she found him, anyway?). This is mostly the result of skipping a very important story from the second book about how the witcher and the girl meet.  A number of other things don't make sense, either. One example would be the inconsistent way sorcery works. We are told doing magic has a cost in life force (not how it is in the books) - illustrated by a flower dying when a stone is levitated. However, this rule seems to apply only for some people and only when it'd look cool. In one scene, a mage is forced to commit suicide in order to create a fireball. Later the same episode, another mage incinerates half a battlefield without any apparent cost.  This brings me to another point - the way the Nilfgaardian empire is portrayed. In the books and games, the Nilfgaard vs. the North clash is just a political conflict serving as backdrop for the fates of Geralt and Cirilla. There is no good or bad, both sides are painted in gray - with ordinary people suffering in the middle. I guess the producers figured this is too complex for the average viewer, so they cast Nilfgaard as evil religious fanatics sacrificing humans, featuring an Arch-baddie™; and they are opposed by the North, ""protecting their way of life"".  On to the more technical side of things - the acting is mostly OK. People seem to swear by Cavill's performance, but he is not how I imagined Geralt. Objectively, though, I suppose he does a fine enough job; he brings physicality to the role and seems to be passionate about it off-screen. I dislike what the showrunners have done to the character of Yennefer, but Anya Chalotra plays the part she's been given with intensity. Freya Allan is forgettable as Cirilla, and so is Anna Shaffer as Triss (a minor character in the books and the show, but a major one in the games, so a lot of people have been disappointed by the performance). In a strange move, the show has cast overly young actresses for some sorceresses (Anya Chalotra is 23, but is given the task of conveying the air of confidence and authority of a woman that is 100+ years old; doesn't quite make it), while 18 years old Freya Allan is picked to portray a girl that is just entering her teens. The only actor who I can definitely say nailed his role is Joey Batey as the funny sidekick Jaskier.  The music is also mostly alright. ""Toss a coin to your witcher"" seems to have conquered the charts, though I think it doesn't fit the setting's atmosphere (not that the show gets that, either). I prefer ""The last rose of Cintra"" and ""The call of the White Wolf"", but to each his own.  I am not sure how the show manages to occasionally give off B-movie vibes with a budget of $80 mln, but it does. I blame it on the bad directing and the poor artistic design. I don't have such a big problem with the Nilfgaardian armor as everybody seems to have, but was, for example, disappointed by the dryads looking like extras from ""Xena - Warrior princess"".  To wrap it up, ""The Witcher"" is a show that has its high points, but is dragged down to being mediocre by its anxiety to please. It is ""inspired by"" and not ""based on"" the books, like the credits would have you believe - it is more ""The hobbit"" than ""The Lord of the rings"", in more ways than one. And whatever its redeeming qualities, I personally can't forgive Netflix for ruining the adaptation of my favourite fantasy story. But the show has actually gone on to become fairly popular, a second season has been confirmed. Thus, Netflix has fulfilled what seems to have been their objective - retain subscribers in the face of stiffening competition. People who liked the latter seasons of GoT and are now looking for another fantasy fix will likely enjoy this series, too. But considering the source material, the show could have been so much more, had it had the guts to not just take the shortcut to Season 2. Perhaps the next installment will deliver on this potential - though I personally don't have my hopes up.",5,neutral
"Very slow start. Lots of cringe. The ""girls"" claim to be sophomores (?). In what? - high school? Why does every show feel the need to have twenty-something actors play teenagers? Rather silly. Let a 15 year old actor play a 15 year old character for once.",4,negative

"I just got done watching all 9 episodes of The Last of Us and wanted to give my full review on the first season. So first off, HBO has definitely got another win on their hands with this show. It is unlike any other apocalypse show I've ever seen and unlike anything that's ever been made. The fact that the actual game developers were heavily involved with the making of this show is part of why this show has paid off big time. Pedro Pascal as the lead character Joel was a dream casting come true as a smuggler with a dark past in a apocalyptic world who is tasked with getting a young girl named Ellie across the country west who might be the key to saving humanity in exchange for help to find his brother Tommy. Ellie played by Bella Ramsey absolutely owns this role as the young girl with a past of her own who is just now experiencing and exploring the apocalyptic world for the first time while making a connection with her new found protector Joel. The chemistry between Ellie and Joel in the show is so on point and is very much like how the video game portrayed the two together as well. The way Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey do portray the characters though, is in a way that doesn't make people think they're just mimicking the game, but bringing their own sense or versions of the characters to the show which is why I loved how they both were portrayed here. It made me care for the two characters that I've come to love even more in this live action adaptation. The set designs I have to say are some of the best I've ever seen to come from HBO or any television series period. They really made this show just like how the video game is. Especially when it comes to how the infected are portrayed. The rest of the cast was great as well in their own ways too. I kinda wish we gotten a little more of Nick Offerman's character Bill like how we got him in the games, but I was satisfied in the end with how HBO handled his character. Troy Barker who is the original voice of Joel in the game who also plays James in show I was glad to see make a appearance. As well as Ashley Johnson who was the voice of Ellie in the games, but played Ellie's mom in the show. I think they both executed their roles well being Easter Eggs for fans of the games. Overall, this is probably one of my favorite projects to come from HBO and one that I will be more than happy to revisit in the future as this is one of the greatest video game adaptations I've ever seen with the help of its two leading characters, a great story, and fantastic set designs. Rating 10/10.",9,positive
"I very rarely watch any casted TV. I'd much rather watch content that promotes; introspection, altruism, new prospective, knowledge and maturity.... But I must say this show is a masterpiece. It shows how truly damaged human beings really are. How maniacal and selfish, willing to go to any links to gratify themselves or gained position. Never revealing their real motives even to there friends, children and spouses. How truly immature we are having no self knowledge thinking we know everything. Lying about everything scared to death of everything. I think it's a true self portrait of how most really are. Even if they never show it to the extent that the show did. Well you ever truly know somebody. Will someone ever take the time to be introspective enough to know themselves. Will you ever be able to trust somebody. Is transparency and selflessness a myth. Romanticize but never realized. All questions the show Post in a masterful way. It's been years since I've watched a casting shower. But this show truly polarized and captivated my mind. Allowed me to Ponder upon myself and my fellow man. I actually gained from watching a show. Something a show like this has never allowed me to do or even intrigue me enough to try. I can only hope that as we roll into this 21st century we move away from such immaturities and selfishness. Start to Value introspection and altruism and grow into our rightful place of maturity and selflessness. To be a happy and peaceful family as a species. Bravo.",8,positive

There are hints from Harry Potters, past monster and high school movies. Nothing was really original. Not a single episode you could enjoy from start to end. There are glimpses of creativity from Tim Burton but fades quickly.  I think audience deserves better. The directors should not assume audience is stupid and shall swallow all!",10,positive

The scale of shows doesn't really starts at 1 and ends at 10, it's more like 7 to 9, so 8 is smack in the middle.  It's not a new idea, has no incredibly tense or sophisticated plot and actually it's not clear where we go from here so, just enjoy it but, 9.1? Seriously???",10,positive
I've always liked the Adam's Family. Mainly the black and white tv show but I have to admit this was pretty entertaining. I pretty much binge watched it with forced intermissions for life. Tim Burton has always been one of my favorites but lately had fallen off my radar. I was a huge fan of Beetlejuice and the Keaton Batman movies and this gave me the same nostalgia. There is definitely a strong pull to the Adam's Family of old but this is definitely an update with a woeful flair. Jenna Ortega was simply terrific and Christina Ricci was a wonderful nod but also refreshing to see how quirky wonderful she is. I also have to admit Fred Armisen is not my favorite actor but as Fester he was amazing. Hopefully this continues ........ The END?,9,positive
"As I write, the current IMDB rating for this series is 9.2, which places it among legendary series like The Wire, The Sopranos, or Game of Thrones. Please. This series incorporates themes from Children of Men (2006) and various post-apocalyptic road films, but does not rise to the level of the best of any of them. I am 5 episodes into the series and there are already some minor problems with the series, although it is highly watchable overall. The acting is decent, and some of the characters more likeable than others. Full disclosure, I haven't played the video game and was not even familiar with it before watching this series. It's a good series, but it's not worthy of an 8+ IMDB rating.",10,positive
"The final episodes ruined it for me. Just a bunch of Taylor Sheridan cowboy porn and spooge. You can tell Sheridan has his hands in too many pies and didn't give the final episodes the thought and time they deserved.  What dialogue there is in the last 7 episodes is not held up by all the country music, drone footage of mountains, long drawn out scenes of Duttons looking forlorn and horse and cow dancing in the dust.  Not being able to figure the contractual stuff with Costner as the lead took this show from the best look at ranch life and family drama in TV. To Sheridan inserting himself in the final episodes as the worst form of male patriarchal chauvinistic abuser of power, pretending he's interesting to listen to telling boring stories of cowboys being stupid, rather than all the excellent drama, action and intrigue that actually happened in the first three seasons. Sigh...The last episodes were very disappointing.  Season 1-3, 8/10. Seasons 4-5, 3/10 which is why I give it an overall 5/10.",8,positive
"I'm always skeptical, when a video game title makes it to film media, especially when it's one of those games that are so great, they could be considered art on par with the art-world's Da Vinci and as a fan of the game, I allowed myself no more than cautious excitement.  However, that changed during the first episode and now I am not just excited but completely sucked in. Already during the pilot, the intro-sequence of the game is caught so perfectly that you can feel the chaos, powerlessness and desperation through the actor's great delivery, the outstanding camerawork and the set and sound design. I would go as far as to say that the first episode is as close to flawless as anything can be.  It is not about making a complete 1-1 copy of the game. Gaming is another medium and so it is about translating it to fit the medium you're using. Needless to say, the directors and writers have done an extraordinarily good job. I look forward to seeing this series earn its place among ones like Breaking Bad, Sopranos and the like and never be another Walking Dead.",10,positive

"I enjoyed both seasons of this show, but I can understand why people wouldn't. This show is slow, and doesn't really have a plot per se; it's about a bunch of rich people at a resort getting dinner, walking around, and talking to each other. This show decidedly feels its length, it definitely doesn't fly by. Despite this though, I never felt bored while watching. I think this is due to the fact that the dialogue is well-written and every performance is great. I really couldn't point out a weak performance from any actor in either season. While the points the writers are trying to make can get a little heavy-handed at times, I still felt like this was a very well-written show. In a similar show of lesser quality, the dialogue and performances would be over the top and corny, but this show refrains from being either of those things in my opinion. (I also appreciated that when politics are discussed in the first season, the writers make arguments for both sides). The characters are flawed in the way that real people are flawed. While some are aloof and lacking in empathy perhaps, they're not cliché rich TV show villains who are totally unredeemable, only care about material things and are horrible to everyone. It felt refreshing to me; the characters in this show feel more relatable than most TV show characters feel.  The humor in this show is also very subtle, and some of the funniest moments aren't even from jokes or dialogue at all, but come from the situation/a reaction/an expression, etc. I appreciate that this wasn't sophomoric and bombastic and although a few of the characters are fairly zany and are nearing cartoony territory, everyone still feels fairly realistic.  This feels like a relatively unique show to me, and if this is the direction shows are going in the future, I'm all for it. (I know this wasn't a Netflix show, but) I'll take a show like this over something like Kaleidoscope every time.",9,positive
"I found every season to be super interesting and entertaining to watch. In each season you have a sense of where it will go, but you actually don't know before the last minutes where everything is unraveling, tied up and served beautifully. It's probably the only season endings where I am saying ""no, no, no"" and can still smile at human nature.  I actually thought season 3 was even better than the first two seasons. Some of the characters were a bit more complex than in the previous seasons and their internal battles felt more relatable - and the cast were exceptionally good at playing out their characters in a multi dimensional way that made it impossible to dislike them. I would highly recommend watching season 3 - it's definitely not boring, just watch all the expressions and everything that's not said - and enjoy the emotional release when some of the characters express an authentic feeling!",10,positive
"As an unapologetic Star Wars snob, my expectations were naturally tempered for the first ever foray into live-action television meant to venture us deep into the galaxy far, far away. I mean, I didn't want to expect too much, ya know?  Buuuuut, with the canonical show taking place in an intriguing time period never before thoroughly explored by any current Star Wars medium, I happily shelled out my 699 pennies and signed up (early on Day 1, admittedly) for the only modern platform that was going to allow me to unlock this groundbreaking program: Disney+.  After just four episodes, I simply cannot get enough.  These streaming sensations -- which we are forced to consume at a rate of 32 minutes per seven days -- feel like genuine fragments of the greater Star Wars masterpieces we have grown to cherish over the last three decades.  But even better?  Yes, quite possibly.  The Mandalorian somehow pulls off the formidable task of both providing something authentic and fresh while still maintaining the unmistakable soul of the original trilogy that spawned one of the most revered fictional franchises in modern pop-culture history.  The characters are rich and captivating in their own unique forms, often downright likable, and credibly flawed. Like all sentient beings, they are genuinely motivated, never performing nasty deeds or saving the day simply fill a shallow archetype.  Even the show's title character is the antithetical embodiment of the naive farmboy from Tatooine. He's kills for credits, appears to avoid anything but the most superficial relationships and just plain kicks ass. It doesn't take long before we are introduced to the his cadre of lethal, resourceful and potent weapons of swift-destruction. Within the first three episodes we see him vaporize a pack of Jawas, burn a Stormtrooper to a crisp, blow up half a building, snap bones, slice bodies and use various other ways to send his adversaries to sleep.  He's a hunter, an alpha riding solo in his sweet starship and someone to be feared.  But then, something happens.  I'm not here to spoil anyone's experience, because this is a piece of entertainment best enjoyed with a with a blank slate, but the Mandalorian begins to show a level of depth I did not expect. Sure, I knew they were going to have to flesh-out his character, being that he is the titular mister and all, but the undeniably dynamic Jon Favreau shows his skills from the start.  What makes this show so unique is the fact that I am exploring each episode with someone with only the slightest knowledge of any Star Wars lore and ethos. He's as enthralled as much as the hard-core fan obsessed with the overall connective tissue and ""Easter eggs"" of the show.  Sit back, relax and enjoy.",10,positive

"The show is a major disappointment. It is poorly written, poorly acted, and poorly directed. The main actress, Jenna Ortega, is particularly bad. She is completely miscast as Wednesday Addams.  Ortega is too old and too mature for the role. She is also too bland and one-dimensional. She doesn't have the charisma or the comedic timing to play Wednesday Addams.  The rest of the cast is also terrible. The supporting characters are all one-dimensional and stereotypical. The adults are all incompetent and the teenagers are all annoying.  The writing on the show is also terrible. The dialogue is cheesy and unrealistic, and the plot is predictable and unoriginal. The show relies heavily on clichés, such as the love triangle and the fish-out-of-water scenario.  Overall, Wednesday is a terrible TV show. The acting is bad, the writing is bad, and the directing is bad. I would not recommend this show to anyone, especially if you are a fan of the Addams Family.  Emphasis on the main actress:  Jenna Ortega is simply not a good actress. She is completely miscast as Wednesday Addams. She is too old, too mature, too bland, and too one-dimensional for the role. She doesn't have the charisma or the comedic timing to play Wednesday Addams.  Ortega's performance is one of the main things that ruins the show.

"The cast is phenomenal! You can't help but feel for the characters and what they are going through on screen. The dialogue between the characters is excellent, the pace of the story is nearly perfect and the chemistry between various characters onscreen is something that stays with you long after you finish the series. There's also a genuine element of mystery built into the overarching thematic stratagems of the show, and at times it makes you wonder what's going to happen next. Tim Burton did a wonderful job putting this together and hats off once again to Netflix for making yet another fantastic show that stands on its own. It's worth mentioning that I had doubts in the beginning as I watched the pilot episode about whether Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzmán were going to be good in this new interpretation for Gomez and Morticia. It did not take long to see while they were chosen for their leading roles in the cast. They were outstanding. This show is addictive! Of course, Jenna Ortega's portrayal of Wednesday in the series was epic. I can't imagine anyone else ever playing this role after seeing her performance in this series.

"Teenage drama with interesting atmosphere. Too bad the plot is built to lead the viewer to conclusions that are later proved wrong, the clues are sometimes subtle, at other times very obvious, but in the end they're all red herrings. This wouldn't be a problem if an attentive viewer could figure out who's done it but the twists come completely out of left field. Actually the viewer can sometimes foresee what happens next by paying attention to the clues and imagining what would be the most stupid and absurd plot twist that makes all clues and plot points completely misleading or useless: ""These scenes completely prove x will happen, but y would make for more drama and is completely unexpected so that's how the it's gonna go"".  The legal system doesn't make any sense. Caught grave robbing? Trespassing? Kidnapping and torturing? Get out scot free by the power of being the main character.  On the point of the main character, I get what they try to give her a somber and morbid personality but after a bit it comes out just as an insufferable edgy teenager that always says the most unpleasant things that comes to mind just for the sake of being unpleasant. I wanted her to be smart, methodic, pragmatic, but no, she sure is smart but get only other character trait is being unpleasant.  Why are people trying to help out befriend her? She only lies and mistreats everybody. She doesn't do anything whatsoever for anybody at any point that to justify people wanting to be around her. I expected that she would be insufferable but actually get things done for the good of others so they would be willing to help her along but no, they only try to help and befriend her because the show would be boring without more characters.  The acting by some of the actors is sometimes so stifled and robotic that it sounds like a random person picked out of the street mocking a middle school children's play. That's specially obvious when compared to the main actress who completely nailed her part, the actor that plays Gomez and the actress that plays the principal.  All in all it's just a morbid, kind of comedic and poorly developed teenage drama that revolves around an outcast main character. If you have low spectations or enjoy watching shows while playing on your phone this is well worth the watch!",3,negative

"*Updated for season 3* Season 3 started off weird. It has a horrible soundtrack, for one thing. The choppy editing could be better. However I think so far it might be the best of the 3. It actually has characters that aren't over the top annoying or caricatures. You have people to like in this show, to actually root for rather than against. It's far less political which makes it automatically 100 times better than the other 2. And at first it annoyed me that each episode ends with a whimper, not a bang...but I actually prefer it now. It's just a pleasant show to wind down with. Walter Goggins probably makes this season shine more as well.  --------- After binging the second season and then the first for two days, it seemed like you were watching two different series. They just happened to have two of the same characters, but other than that, the pace, intent, and the point seemed different.  The second season had a more solid cast with pretty stellar performances by nearly everyone. There seemed to be several messages unlike in the first season, and while it did come off as preachy and pretentious, not nearly as much as the first. It also had a great mystery factor to it and was more of a tragic dramedy with enough comic relief that it wasn't too overly dramatic, if not a bit unrealistic.  The first season suffered quite a bit after the first episode. It didn't have as much humor after the first episode and didn't pull you in. Not a single character had any redeeming qualities and weren't relatable at all, using dialogue no one uses in real life, ending up in situations that just don't happen. I'm not sure what the point of it or the meaning of it was, if there was one. It was mostly pouty people who were either rich or poor, but snobs either way. People have more nuance than this and I'm not sure what demographic HBO is reaching out to with this tripe, but it's not for the majority of the worldwide population.  The second season would make me want to watch a 3rd, and if you haven't seen the first, you could just skip straight to the 2nd without missing a beat.",7,neutral
The Mandalorian is single handily saving the star wars universe. This show in my opinion has not had one bad episode. Season 2 really drove me to write this review and express my year of love for this show.  The Mandalorian season 2 truly brought tears to the eye of watchers. Not only because of the surprise at the end but because of the amazing acting. The acting in this show is truly incredible and they have some of the best in the world.

"I'll admit, I didn't want to like this show. At seeing the first trailers I thought the concept had been done enough.  However, while there has been good action in the first episodes, what makes this show different (and amazing) is the storytelling. Although this is a series with a full season plot, it is somewhat episodic and the adept writing and acting helped me care about more than just the main characters. The third episode in particular told a story I that was completely unexpected.  The fact that this show has everyone searching the internet for the potential reality of the premise for this particular downfall of humanity should say a lot.  Even if you've watched other ""end of the world"" series, you owe it to yourself to watch this one.",10,positive
"After big disappointments like Obi-Wan Kenobi and The Book of Boba Fett, we finally have a Star Wars series for adults. Chapters VII-IX have made chapters I-III less mediocre. Solo fell short of what the character deserved. Fortunately, The Mandalorian has lived up to expectations. And Rogue One has been the only film capable of maintaining the quality of the original trilogy. I'm glad to revisit Cassian's character in Andor. He is complex, dark, not a cliché designed to be liked by everybody. And the Empire is portrayed as a technological terror, not an army of aimless unskilled troops. Disney should take note of what the true way is and stop flooding the saga with poor quality content. THIS is the way!",8,positive
"I binged watched The Witcher, one whole day in front of my TV and it was worth it. I couldn't stop watching the episodes because I wanted to see what would happen next, I love the actors for their roles and I think they did a superb job. I read two books up to now, and I will continue reading the other six. I'm so glad Netflix already renewed it for another season and I hope they continue for the next few years, when all the books have been made to one season. This is fantasy, this is completely different from GoT, so if you want to watch it, ignore the people with bad reviews, this show is different and awesome.",10,positive
"If you look under the hood of most acting performances, in spite of how emotionally well-rendered they may be, they are ultimately a single-point expression of a broader sense of humanity with very few specifying factors. A great example of this phenomenon is the TV show Severance, superior to The White Lotus in every aspect of filmmaking, save the acting.  The performances in Severance, or The Morning Show, or Watchmen, are of types of human beings: a four-word summative description of the characters can be generated which then applies to every single scene they shall be a part of. The specifics of their behavior can be predicted because of an emotional simplicity and a narrowness in behavioral variation. Even when they change over time, it's only the externalities prescribed by the world around them that define these changes.  For example, Adam Scott's character in Severance is never not a solemn wallflower, John Turturro's character is never not a purehearted nerd; it's not a deficiency in writing or acting, but a failure in merging both into a cohesive whole. The depth these characters posses is not in layers of emotion, but in multiplicity of screenplay adjectives; it's not that actable.  None of these issues plague the characters of The White Lotus, who always feel at least four separate ways about any of the situations they find themselves in; the character work was focused inside-out. The actors perform the behavior of their characters based on an intimate and unambiguous knowledge of their complexly layered emotion, and not simple cues of what they need to ""look"" like externally.  The writing itself in terms of scene construction and dialog is above functional. It keeps you unwaveringly engaged.  The cinematography is ""good"" if you're not very visually conscious, but I found the compositions to be lacking. Images are pretty sunsets and orange-hued firelights, but there's not a specific sense of order of elements in relation to camera.  A remarkable aspect of the technical filmmaking is the editing of the final episode, which uses interruption of narrative momentum and rhythmic matches in behavior (head down to head up etc) to seamlessly weave and tighten the knots of suspense to a morbidly sharp climax.  The second season ranks even superior. The behavioral rendering and characterization is deep enough to warrant exploration by shoddily-constructed submarine. Loved the central couples.  Soundtrack is unique and immersive.  Speaking of immersion, the underwater shots of both seasons feel not like cinematographic showboating, but interments into the private psychic coffins these characters walk socially entombed within.  Show would be a perfect 10 - weren't the characters so vapid; as people, not as characters.  As that they're incomparably infinite.  8/10.",10,positive
"The initial two seasons were passable, with some promise. However, the third season proves to be a complete squandering of time. It fails to evoke any genuine emotions, not even passion between Yennefer and Geralt. The plot twists are lame, failing to provide any unsuspecting turns that would keep viewers on the edge of their seats. The script itself is poorly constructed, devoid of creativity and imagination. Without prior knowledge of the book's story, this adaptation becomes nearly unwatchable. The overwhelming abundance of bewildering names, territories, kingdoms, and characters only adds to the confusion. Is this the new direction entertainment is taking? I sincerely hope this is not a prevailing trend. What we truly yearn for is the immersion effect, eagerly awaiting the next episode, and being wholly captivated by the unfolding narrative. We long for the days of Game of Thrones' first six seasons, where every episode was a gripping masterpiece. I have added an additional 2 stars solely for the exceptional talent of the actors; they are truly outstanding. However, even their brilliant performances could not overshadow the pervasive flaws of the plot.",9,positive
I really enjoyed this show. Wasn't always too quality but was engaging and a good bit of Fantasy telly. Just watched the last of series 3 and now I'm just disappointed. The last two episodes are nothing but baiting towards the next series to keep people watching once cavill has left. There's no resolution to anything at all. Which has dropped this from top tier for me down to game of thrones series 8 rubbish. I very much doubt I'll watch series 4 even more now as feel like series three is a waste of time cos it's all setups. What a way to waste talent and a good show. Sorry Netflix but you've messed up big time.,10,positive
"I had been looking forward to this series since it was announced, and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. Suffice to say I binged watched it in 2 days.  The story caters, of course , to the modern audience, but it is not smothered by political correctness as most current shows are (which is a blessing). It is interesting, dark, and a blend of old and new, all wrapped in a fun Burton-esque way.  The lead actress is fantastic, she really captures the personality of Wednesday, she even nails the dead, cold but intense stare. But kudos should be given to the rest of the cast, because they do a great job as well,I loved Gwendoline Christie as the Head Mistress, she really plays ambiguous characters very well. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzman are perfect in their roles, and the actress who portrays Enid (Emma Myers) nails the character.  Of course there are mistakes and inconsistencies (a rainy day suddenly becoming extra sunny, with no evidence of the previous rain at all, etc), but all in all, those mistakes don't negatively affect the quality of the series.  I really don't understand the viewers who compare it to the movies, and expect it to be the same. It can't be. It's been 30 years since the Addams Family movies, the world has changed, we are supposed to be moving forward and keeping up with the times. Please stop comparing old and new, ""Wednesday"" isn't a remake, it's a brand new series based on one of the characters, not the Addams Family as a whole. This series, pays a great homage to the original Addams Family, but it is firmly set in the present- as it should be.  Old and new can be equally worth your time, each one for its own merits.  8/10 from me, with the potential to go higher for the next season(s).",6,neutral

"Set in a dystopian future where plummeting birth rates inspire a radical theocratic overthrow of the US government. Women who are fertile yet do not conform to the religious archetype are punished by serving as ""handmaids"", where they are systematically raped on a monthly basis for the excuse of bearing children for their assigned household. While it might be more relatable to explore having children as a means of maintaining generational political power, this work skips the pretense and cuts straight to the egoism of those perpetuating the system.  Season one brilliantly explores the interactions between the different classes in this hypothetical society, with appropriate contrast to ""the way it was before"". This is likely the season that earned its high IMDB rating.  Season two is honestly not bad, pushing the boundaries of where and how a resistance might form in such a miserable society. It ends with a fantastic cliffhanger that made me eager for season three.  Season three was disappointing. It really felt like they stopped trying with the writing, and just filmed scenes written for and rejected from seasons one and two. Maybe they didn't expect to get this far, so they just stopped writing good stuff? To their credit, they chained the scenes together reasonably well, but there's still many plotholes, and it defies plausibility so far as to drag you out of the experience.  Based on the cliffhanger from season three, and season three in its entirety, I am not excited for season four, and would recommend future viewers just stop with season two. It was good to that point.",6,neutral
How long can u watch a beaten dog getting beat?? This show is the most miserable and long winded iv ever had the displeasure of watching. The acting is great but it's just misery after misery so go stare at some bricks and get some joy in ya life because u will not find a single minute of it here. Super yawn.

"I never expected Star Wars to find its way back into my heart like this. But this brilliantly written and produced piece of fiction reminded me -deeply- what it means to be an activist, a rebel, someone who truly cares about the generations to come.  It's a striking example of what talented people can create when they believe in the story they're telling, especially when contrasted with the soulless content Disney has been churning out in recent years. This show warmed my heart and reassured me:  Star Wars is not dead.  What it needs is real storytelling and real talent, like Toby Haynes and the incredible Andor crew. Just as importantly, it needs to be made for adults. Kids will watch anyway. They'll love it, and they'll learn from it, just like we did back in the day. (I still remember those Darth Vader nightmares.)  Star Wars was never just for kids. It was for all of us, when we needed it most. Andor proves that again.  It's not about lightsabers or nostalgia. It's about truth, resistance, and the heavy cost of hope. Telling the story of ordinary people and their real struggles against authoritarian power is incredibly powerful. Just as George Lucas intended when he based the Rebellion on the Vietcong.  Andor, with its distinctive tone, casting, and design, isn't just the future of Star Wars.  It's the only future.",10,positive

It was a good first episode, lots of explanation and the parallels were very fun to see.  I'm excited to see where this show goes. The visuals are great, the mood fits for a post-apocalypse world and the backstory added to the depth of the characters. I truly think this show has earned the attention it's garnered and will continue to with each episode that is released.  If you want something captivating, more interesting than the Walking Dead, and an incredibly sweet ode to the game it comes from, this is the show for you.",10,positive
"This is totally not about Wednesday. It's about grumpy goth kid walking around and can't even solve misteries. Very dumb. As a Addams family movie and cartoon enjoyer in 90's, it gave me high hopes at the beginning but later turned into poorly executed series just to feed the hungury subscribers constantly waiting for new content.  It is definitely entertaining for teenage kids. It can be 8/10 in that category but definitely not in my oppinion. It had potential.  Story was very predictable. Writes should take examples from japanese animes or korean series, spare some time and put some effort into story. Seems like they just filled every cliche plot twists in the book and created just another fabrication mistery series. I've watched kid shows with better twists. It bored me.  Wednesday's punchlines were very boring and cringy. Not like in the 90's movies. They were brilliant.  Acting was ok for the main chacacters, but as i see on the internet, fans are overrating it obviously.  This production kinda ruined the Wednesday chacater in my mind. I excpeted way more intelligent, psychopath Wednesday and maybe few more torturing scenes, but with dark humour not horror. All she does walk around,stare and say forced darkish sentences.  Oh the cgi.. I don't wanna talk about it.  Costumes and decorations are ok. Enjoyed the atmosphere but compared to 90's movies...No no no.  Dance and cello part was good. That's why we see just them everywhere on the internet but they can't save the show for me.",4,negative

Actors/actresses from well-known to unknown, director, make-up, set creators, etc. I get that the timeline is an issue for everyone, and yeah they should've told the audience when it shifted but outside of that (and the casting of Triss), this show is wildly entertaining and an excellent watch.",7,neutral

"I was skeptical about this show seeing it's based on a video game and it never ends up good on screen, but I am hooked after the first two episodes. This show is really good and I felt like I was watching the video game play out all over again. I seen other reviewers saying Ellie is miscast and I can see it somewhat but it's not that bad to put me off from watching, Joel is perfectly cast and I'm excited to see how this all plays out. IMO this is one of the best if not the best video game adaptions to hit the big screen. The city and the surroundings are also identical to the first game and the clickers are just as freaky on screen as in the game.",10,positive
"What sets Wednesday Addams from rest of Today's heros ? Wednesday Addams reconsiders.  Yes. That is the one important and crucial quality was missing from Today's overconfident ,know it all,all powerful heros.  And It took Tim Burton to point it out. Every encounter Wednesday has with other characters ,she immediately get upperhand with her snappy replies but every once in a while something caught her off guard and she is wise enough to think those through. Ultimately that makes her progressively evolved.  I like the overall Machivellian ,Edgar Allan Poe theme and usage of music throughout the season. It is a breath of fresh air especially the music . It encaptures the soul of some situations perfectly.",10,positive

"The show is a must watch, however I agree with others - the pace is slow and be prepared to forward past some of the scenes. Especially season 5. I think the relationship between June and Serena is portrayed amazingly - emotional and dynamic. Elizabeth Moss - I don't know who could've played the role better, she says so much without saying anything at all (the did go overboard though past season 3). Season 5 - Luke gets more pathetic, if that's even possible! I think the show is definitely coming to an end and I hope it'll be a good one. Should've ended with season 5 - the amount of empty scenes.",10,positive

I'm a huge fan of Star Wars. Saw ESB and ROTJ as a kid in the theater. I haven't been impressed with much of what Disney has done with the exception of Rogue One.

"Pretty bad acting by all other than the lead. Reminiscent of teen angers' first high school play The story line is mediocre. Bad writing. They take the Christina Ricci version of Wednesday and turn it up to 11. This is not a compliment. It is very forced. The creation of an Addams family universe has resulted in lore that borrows too heavily from Harry Potter. I cannot believe Tim Burton is attached to this. It is uncharacteristically bad for him.  Production and effects are good enough. Just a notch better than a CW production. I understand people like this. It really does not speak to me. I am a fan of the original television series. I thought the movie adaptations were decent, but not great. That is where I am coming from.  Edit: I've upped it from a 4 to a 6. It got better as the series went along. The teen actors seemed to find their hooves a bit, and the story line picked up. Still has many flaws, IMO.",10,positive
"Seasons one and two were fantastic and Disney could seem to do no wrong with the show. However season three has proved that is no longer the case. There are so many idiotic plot holes, lazy writing and just plain bad acting that I'm fast giving up hope on the series now. Mando was a badass in the first couple of seasons but now he's playing second fiddle to a another character and being made to look inadequate or just plain dumb and it really hurts the show. Can only assume they've lost the plot and run out of ideas.  Given this was the only reason I bothered having a Disney+ subscription I'm pretty disappointed. I've got the message loud and clear Disney and I won't be renewing when this season ends, if I can even be bothered watching the rest of it!",9,positive

I wish, it keep up that way and i am pretty sure it will... it deserves the high score it gets 'till now and this show is already viral here in Greece and everyone talks about it... keep on mind that it's a drama horror story like walking dead and invasion, so do not wait brutal scenes all the time and continuously action, there will be slow paced scenes and emotional moments so maybe it's not everyone's cup of tea!

"I feel silly writing a review of Yellowstone. If you haven't watched this series yet, why not? Do you not like great television? Are you turned off by TV shows that are too deep and too beautiful? I don't know what to say to convince you except that Yellowstone is among the greatest television shows ever made. Yes, I would and I do compare it to Game of Thrones, The Sopranos or Deadwood. I spent most of my long life hating Kevin Costner but, as John Dutton, the patriarch of a Montana ranching family that is holding on to what it has by its fingernails, he is excellent. Everybody wants take away what they have. There's a nearby Reservation that wants the land returned to them. Companies that want to turn the land into resorts. And none of the children are certain they want to be part of Dutton's legacy. Writer and co-creator Taylor Caldwell doesn't pull any punches. Ranchers are hard men. And Dutton is the hardest of them all. Costner, as much as I used to hate him, is a superb grizzled ranch owner. We see the hardness. We understand his will to hang on to the land even as others try to take it from him. He loves his children. He just doesn't do it very well. He's too hard and set in his ways for that. The rest of cast is superb. There's not a false step anywhere. They're all, the children, the ranch hands, and his enemies fully fledged human beings, three dimensional, well written and excellently acted. Add the the breathtaking scenery the haunting use of the very best of country music (even if you're not a country music fan, these songs will haunt you...) add just the right amount of humour and you get a series that can and should be watched more than once. It isn't good. It's great. We're at the climax of the golden age of television. And among all the great offerings out there Yellowstone will still stand out as a rare and magnificent gem. It shouldn't be reviewed. It should be applauded. And now you can also watch the superb prequel 1883. Watch them both. And then watch them again. And again. Or don't. Maybe you hate great television. If that's you, then there's more than enough reality TV or formula glibness out there for you. It may be the golden age of television. But the bottom part of the pile is still more than full of... Well, maybe, what some people like...",10,positive
I'm starting episode 5 now... if I hadn't already invested due to seasons 1 & 2 ... wld have quit watching by now... every episode is SO SLOW!! Not the same pace as previous seasons in any way!! Really disappointed at this point... hanging on hoping it improves... season 4 better take notes from season 1&2 or... doubt there will be a season 5. The plot seems apparent but .. the character build up is root canal ish ... slow and painful. There is no wow factor... in previous seasons every episode left you shocked ... disturbed... wanting more... this season? I'm like ummm ... when is anything going to happen? Not impressed.,6,neutral
First few seasons were great. Then it turned into a modern day soap opera (think Dallas). Everything was over the top and the acting is getting worse each episode.  Beth has become tiresome and the show without the main character John is just repetitive. The writing and script has turned into every acting unrealistic.  Season 5 was just lame and the producer Taylor Sheridan writing himself into the script as a playboy cowboys was just embarrassing.  People just do not talk and carry on like season 5. I am glad that it has come to an end and honestly grateful that i don't need to subject myself to another season of it.,10,positive
"1st and 2nd seasons are a solid 8/10, and overall a very good time.  3rd season is like, 5/10 at best. Very very undercooked characters and plotlines despite being the longest season. Not the biggest fan of the ending either, mostly because 90% of the setup done throughout the season went basically nowhere. Probably the least impressed I have been by the writing,although it might also be the magic of the premise starting to wear off for me by this point so I'm less willing to overlook things. Or maybe things just didn't come together right which is fine I guess.  Still definitely looking forward to season 4 though.",2,negative
"After binging all of it , i can now safely say that this show is nowhere near masterclass. First of all, this series spend way to much time on things that doesn't matter, on characters we don't care about. The overall feeling i have after seeing the entire first season is that this is adapted very close to how the games work, where we have Geralt walking from one place to the other, picking up side quests as he goes along.  Now side quests are perfectly fine in Games, but they are called side quests for a reason, and this TV show should be more focused on it's core narrative. It does however start to pick up by episode 5 or thereabouts, but by then i was really tired of watching things that didn't matter.  You could actually draw parallels from this show to ""The Mandalorian"", they are sort of based on the same story narrative. Where the protagonist walks from one place to the next, picking up jobs on the way. But the entire tone is completely different, as ""The Mandalorian"" doesn't take itself too seriously, and loves to play around a bit, ""The Witcher"" is the opposite. So IMO, this fall ""The Mandalorian"" was a big surprise and a series i find quite entertaining, while ""The Witcher"" disappoints.  The acting in The Witcher isn't that good either, i mean, it really isn't. The costumes aren't that great either. The entire show feels cheap in places it shouldn't feel cheap. If you are going to make a dead serious show, you better have the money behind it.  But the cinematography are at times spectacular, with beautiful landscape shots with great color grading. But when it comes to battle sequences, they could be shot way better. Before this show came out, the producers said this show would make GoT fighting scenes look dull, that's not the case what so ever. For everyone who saw ""Battle of the Bastards"", you know it would take some effort to make those scenes look dull. It is of course possible to make something better, but this show isn't one of those shows.  This show is as it stands right now, rated way too high.  The show gets better with each episode, but not much. First season overall is not much more than a mediocre experience which should focus more on being a TV series, rather than a computer game.  6/10 - Fair",2,negative
"I was surprised how good the first season was, far better than the Tom Cruise movies, it was interesting, funny with a great lead actor and great supporting characters, the story was really good and i binged the entire season  but the second season is a real disaster in every sense, unconvincing, boring, bad casting of Reacher's ""superhero"" friends, i forced myself to watch it till the end and surfing the internet on phone more than looking at the tv screen and i couldn't wait for it to end and i don't want to waste another single word on it, like two completely different tv shows,  i ended up giving it a 7 with the hope that the second season is just a bad dream and that the third season will be like the first.",9,positive

If you like CW shows this will be right up your street, if not you might find yourself a little disappointed but then again you'd miss out on a great performance by Jenna Ortega.

This is.  Ortega was a new actress to me, but I am a fan now. Wednesday's sardonic character and deadpan delivery chimed beautifully as she delivers her brand of honesty to all those around.  The school of unusual children could be a bit Harry Potter, and the 'mystery' a bit Scooby-Doo, and the plot a bit predictable, but dont let it put you off. The most important thing was that it put a smile on my face and kept me entertained... and that I'll be back for Season 2.",5,neutral

I dare to say that it's at least as good as Game of Thrones, if not better.  As you may have already read, Peaky Blinders is about Birmingham gangsters and how they work towards their ""success"" (depends on what you'd call a success). The show is thrilling and shocking and I even laughed out loud at some moments. The show knows how to get strong family bond between the characters across.  The characters have depth and they are easy to connect with. It's funny how the show makes you root for the some of the worst criminals you'd ever see. You'll be able to connect with them because they still have a soft side, they do things for a reason. Like Tommy Shelby the main character. Tommy is the gang leader and he is selfish and brutal but everybody still loves him. It's because there are things he truly cares about and loves, and he loves deeply. But he knows what he's doing and he'll always manage to somehow get out of tricky situations.  Another reason I love this show is because Tommy Shelby is just really sexy to me for all the reasons above and obviously his looks and his voice. (but that's just my unprofessional opinion)  I could write a whole book about this show but I will end this here. You should just watch it I know you'll love it",10,positive

Casey's wife just cries all the time, then the lady whom is the advisor to chief rainwater just sits and talks in a threatening but if you are watching the programme.

"Bruce Miller has created a bravura drama series. I've learned some great lessons from this series. First is never judge a show just based on the promotions. I was reluctant to watch the series based on the title, custome and setting. I've never been so wrong. This is a virtuous drama. This series has excellent direction, writing, cinematography, settings, score and acting. The entire cast deliver outstanding portrayals. Moss, Fiennes and Strahovski stand out however it is Moss who commands the series. The plot is unique, original and something I've never seen before. The score adds to the desperate and thrilling tone of the series. The plot takes place in a post Second American Civil War era where a totalitarian government of Gilead establishes the rules. The future society is seperate from the United States and has a hierarchical social class system. Under this new regime women are treated brutally, can not work, own property, handle money or read. The different class groups are divided into Marthas who are housekeepers and servants; Unwomen who are forced to work clearing toxic waste until there death; Aunts who oversee and train the Handmaids; Eyes who are secret police watching over the society; Hunters who track down individuals trying to flee the country to Canada and Handmaids who are women are forced into sexual servitude due to declining birth rates. The main character is June Osborne who was renamed Offred. As it is refered to as 'the time before' June had a daughter, husband and a job. Offred is on a constant quest to escape her captors, Commander Fred Waterford and his wife Serena Joy, and find her husband and her daughter who was stolen from her years earlier. She sometimes gains assistance from a sort of underground network that helps people escape Gilead. Offred is under strict rule, constant harrassment and one wrong move or word can lead to savage punishment. She is also continuously being threatened by her Aunt to be sent down to become an Unwomen. Serena is particularly harsh on Offred because she believes her husband has actual feelings for this human being. Ironically the Waterfords are feeling the consequences of the society they helped to create. The series' examination of totalitarianism and exploitation is unparalleled and the Biblical references are substantial. Moss is a revelation. It is such a privalage to view a lead actress in such a controversial role. Her portrayal and character development is magnificent. The plot is crisp, clever, cathartic, intelligent, sublime, thrilling and exorcising. This series is at the top of the list in the drama genre. I hope this series continues for many seasons.",10,positive
"Let's start with the good. Compelling source material. Classic zombie apocalypse setting. Superb production values. Pedro Pascal, who delivers a compelling and believable performance.  Now the bad. The writing, the writing, and the writing. By far the most tearing-my-own-hair out catastrophe in this whole production is Ellie's dialogue. No teenage girl talks or acts like this. She speaks with the words and cadence of a middle-aged smartass American writer during a cocaine binge, which is of course the person who wrote her lines. But part of basic writing is to write lines that a character would actually say. Her persona is essentially RDJ'd Tony Stark in a teenage girl's body. It's a pathetic, hackneyed, and transparent attempt to give us an uBeR cOoL gIrLbOsS character that we're supposed to love. I doubt many did. Even if the writing was remotely plausible, Bella Ramsay just does not have that sort of charisma.  I'm certain that most people are as bored as I am of this cliche, where they make a child character who is supposed to be precocious or wise beyond her years, but people like that do exist and none of them would ever talk or act like this. It's such a failure on the part of the writer because it breaks your suspended disbelief every time, which could have been avoided.  Unfortunately that's not the only braindead Hollywood cliche that stains this production. We also have the classic 'characters sacrificing themselves for no logical reason whatsoever for a cheap emotional bit', characters who are supposedly survivors but stop and gawp without reacting at all whenever lethal danger comes right at them (so that they can be conveniently saved at the last moment by a cheap plot connivance) and characters running into gunfire to ""save"" other characters who aren't injured and can walk or run perfectly fine.  Overall the plot spends way too much time going nowhere for poor returns in entertainment value.  So yeah. Could have been excellent. Instead is distinctly average.",9,positive
"Disregard any reviews you read where people say this show is boring, it is anything but. The fact that we came very close to this becoming a reality makes this show even more terrifying.

"I'm not really into TV series, and I loathe soaps. So I approached Yellowstone with caution, watching it mainly because I admire Kevin Costner. I enjoyed the first episode which set things up, and having now watched all three seasons I can honestly say the whole series has been outstanding. A couple of episodes in series 3 were a little slow, but that doesn't matter as there is so much action in other episodes it's nice to slow things down. The music is excellent, the scenery is outstanding, the acting is top notch, and the stories are well paced. Costner is superb as John Dutton, he looks born for this part, and is totally convincing in all his scenes. I'm looking forward to series four, and if the writing and acting continues to be of the same standard, I hope the series runs for years to come. There are certainly many avenues for this series to go down as future seasons unfold.",10,positive

"Peaky Blinders is without a doubt one of my favorite tv shows of all-time. I wanted to watch this after seeing the trailers and then I heard so many people talking about how great this show was, literally everyone I know who saw it loved it so it raised my expectations even more. When a show is as loved as this one is it rarely lives up to the expectations. Well, Peaky Blinders not only met those expectations but surpassed them in every way possible. The acting and writing is what makes this show so special but the attention to detail they put into every aspect of this show is amazing. This series will hook you from the very first episode and hold on throughout the entire series. It just takes you into their world for you to enjoy. I can not recommend this show enough.",10,positive
"Very satisfied. As a fan of the game, it's satisfying and even feels like it's done very quickly-even though it's over 70 minutes long.  They really adapted it well. It is worked on in such a way as a TV series so that anyone can enjoy it. They changed the story issue a bit and also added some non-game scenes with the purpose of making everything clear, detailed, and we can get closer to certain characters.  All the actors played well. Before it aired, everyone feels skeptical about the actors. ""They don't look like the game, yada-yada,"" but look, there's no one complaining about it anymore.  As a fan of the game, it seems that I will be a fan of the series as well.",10,positive

"Great action, great acting, great story, and a huge heart. The Mandalorian's third episode just came to Disney+ and I can say without a doubt, this is the best Star Wars has been in decades. (I'm looking at you, sequel trilogy). The Mandalorian is far and away everything a Star Wars fan needs right now. Which is actual Star Wars.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy parts of the new chapters of the Skywalker saga. But overall, these past few years, something has been...missing. I could never put my finger on it until now. The sequel trilogy gives us no reason to care or worry for these characters. With the exception of maybe Finn. Everyone else seems to have the thickest plot armor with no real consequences in their actions. And when they do, they come across as just...pointless.  You could argue that they killed off Luke and Han. Han's death, yes, that was tragic and heartbreaking. But there was the hope that Kylo would realize the mistake of his actions and turn to the light side. Which seems to imply they just did it for shock value.  Luke? Luke made absolutely no sense. His entire character changed to an unrecognizable figure with the same name, but none of the core values that made him special in the original trilogy. Luke has always been my all time favorite Star Wars character. But when he was killed off...did anyone really care?  The Mandalorian changes all of that. If you didn't notice, Chapter 2 starts...and a word isn't spoken for ten straight minutes. (I'm not kidding, go back and check.) Yet there's more spoken that words could explain.  The Mandalorian has been, so far, flawless. There is not one single thing I would change about them. It reminds me why I fell in love with Star Wars in the first place. It takes me back to when I was that little kid, playing with my brand new Star Wars figures under the Christmas tree. When I used to play with my electronic Millenium Falcon while watching the original trilogy.  Every episode I watch, I'm taken back in time. Feeling the same excitement I felt when I saw Hoth for the first time. When I saw Yoda for the first time. When I saw Obi-Wan die for the first time. When I saw Darth Vader find redemption for the first time.  The heart of Star Wars is back. And it's name is The Mandalorian.",9,positive

"I absolutely loved Season 2. Fantasy is not my favorite genre, but after seeing the masterful skill in the end of Season 1 Episode 1, I watched the season at least 6 times and managed to piece together a lot of the background and characters. I loved it as it was unique and spellbinding.  Season 2 has so much rich character development that I could not stop watching and finished the whole season in an evening. My goodness, Freya Allen is a true brilliant actress. I loved seeing Anya's new predicament and her acting also was superb. Visiting the winter home of the Witchers was so informative also. I now have a good knowledge of what kind of circumstances brought them to be Witchers. I can see where Season 3 is headed and there is so much more room for character growth/development and relationship bonding. It is so long to have to wait for Season 3!!  I have so much admiration and respect for Henry Cavill's performance. He is my idea of a person perfectly cast for a character. His performance was so right on and brilliant. His interviews have made me respect him as a man making a contribution to the human race and it makes me esteem him even more. Can't wait to see his portrayal of an even more compassionate Geralt in Season 3 as well as his Masculine Superiority. I don't know why Film Execs think us women want to see Female leads and such, I search out a good film with a manly male lead and for me Henry Cavill can't be beat.  So as a person who did not play the games or read the books, The Witcher is such a good, satisfying story that I hope lives on a long time!",10,positive
"Netflix is synonymous with producing some over rated rubbish. Wednesday though it's simply the best series I have seen on the Netflix platform or that on a whole.  I absolutely loved Jenna Otega's portrayal of Wednesday Addams she is a fine actress whom I'm sure we haven't seen the end off.  The series had a predictable ending but that aside, it was so magical, dark and brought out a softer side of Wednesday yet keeping that cold, emotionless character that Christina Ricci developed in the two films in the 90's.  Bringing Ricci into the series didn't undervalue it, nor was it necessary to add value to it, the acting alone from the principal characters made it a worthwhile, enjoyable watch.  Let's hope there is a series 2.",10,positive
"Why is this show worth your time? It has a perfect amount of conflict in the storyline and the combination of simple but entertaining drama and serious topics is simply irresistable. The actors are well cast and Kevin Costner is perfect in this setting. These people are evil, but complicated and equally motivated by love, honor and a quest for universal justice. I do not know anything about real life in Montana, I live in the country they can fit into their territory, but this version is wildly entertaining, my fascination with horses has hit the roof because i watched this. A great way to show the world how amazing and rough the American way of life can be. It reminds me of Ozark, Succession and Sons of Anarchy. A beautiful and very alluring escape from everyday life and quite violent, but the violence is a big part of the story and not for entertainment only. It holds a lot of food for thought about man and his place in nature and the territorial legacy of the land. I highly recommend it.",10,positive
"THAT was cool!  And I suspected, but only recently discovered that the mini Yoda was practical, not CGI. In fact, most of the things that you would think are CGI are all practical. This is something that amazed me and increased my appreciation for the show tenfold.  I just got done with the 2nd episode, and things are rapidly falling into place.  This is like watching sections of any given Star Wars movie (the best parts) every week. I wasn't expecting this kind of production value. On this scale.  My only complaint? The episodes are too short! Should be longer.  Regardless of that, I look forward to more episodes of this.  After watching three whole seasons of this, my need for Star Wars was sated with several very interesting story arcs going all the way back, Jon Favreau uses everything from Star Wars, not just what we like. He includes important things from the prequel trilogy and other things from other shows, characters from clone wars show up sooner or later. We just have to remember that Star Wars is not just a single show or a single character, it is an entire galaxy, and everything happens all at once, everything, everywhere, all at once in this galaxy. And for the first time ever, we are shown everything that may have been happening behind, closed doors during the movies that we watched. And everything has a name, the little guys in the Cloudcity furnace room that Chewie had to fight to get 3pio's parts back from, they are named. Ugnaughts.  I hope we get more.",9,positive

"Wow, just wow. After I have lost hope for movies because of constant pushing of political narratives here commes something really great and restores my faith. The Mandalorian is a story written so good it chains you to the screen. You get sucked into dark, troubling and hard world of a merc that has a painful story behind him but also a somehow good heart. The character was so well writen that I'm amazed. He has flawes, weaknesses and sometimes even looses battles only to solve a problem on a different way. He is not a regular Marry Sue character that can beat 100 guys on his own, sometimes he has to run, sneak and retreat. I hope this series will get at least 10 seasons because I would like to follow Mando's strougle trough entire universe since I can relate so much with him and because this is the only series that is worth watching and is not infected by SJW leftist political agendas and constant pushing of narratives. I hope writes and all people who are contributing to this show stay the same and don't bend to pressure from people that wants to destroy everything good just so that they can brainwash people. Mando is best thing that happened to Star Wars and to movie making scene in last 10 years. I can't wait to watch the next episode because it got me hooked up.",10,positive
"Im actually very impressed with how this show is done. I love how they made this into a comedy/horror but also a mystery/thriller series. It always made me want to watch the next episode. Jenna ortega is the perfect Wednesday. She pulls off the dark and cold personality but also shes got this look and vibe that makes you want to still care about her like how her roommate is. Also, no one else would've been a better director than Tim Burton. Through his history, we know hes the best when it comes to combining the genres of horror and family. Perfect guy for the job. Also, despite the show being centered around wednesday, it was good that they involed the rest of the Adams family to bring up past stories in the family history which ended up driving the strength of the shows story telling. I hope there will be more seasons to come. Well done guys.",10,positive
"Season 1 - 10/10  Season 2 - 8/10  Season 3 - 5/10  I have rated third season a respectable 5, but seriously it desrves just a 4, the extra +1 is for grogu's defiance alone.  The first two seasons were a masterpiece, especially for a guy like me who has never watched StarWars. Truly engaging and and full of surprises.  But the third season is so lame and slow. I never imagined it to be so boring. Never thought watching Mandalorioan would be a waste of precious time of my life. Please do not make the fourth season like the third. Better to end the devlopment completely and call it off.  That would be the way!!",9,positive
"I binge watched the first season two times in a row, it was so fresh and familiar at the same time... I am not familiar with the books and didn't watch the movies, so it was a completely clean slate for me.  I liked it, a lot, easily an 8 or 9 for me... a big Arnie style guy but smart and witty? A lone wolf doing A-team style justice in America? A complex counterfeiting conspiracy in a small southern town? Corrupted police? It checked all boxes, very entretaining with mistery, action, comedy, clever dialogue and writing.  So I was ready to continue with season 2... nothing could go wrong right?. Well it did... what a letdown! Nothing was there... it was a totally different series, visually, and in terms of acting, dialogue and writing... what the hell happened there? By the looks and what I read everywhere the problem, as usual, is that the first season was faithful to the source material, whereas the second diverged... here we go again, smart writers screwing up a great idea, how not!  Special mention to the ""season finale""... oh boy! What an epic trainwreck... what a disgraceful writing, what stupid villains... what rushed mess accompanied by no less than half runtime of the lamest ""resolutions"". Season 2 is a clear 4... which makes an average of 6 for Reacher, I am afraid. If next season gets better it will be taken into account... hoping!",3,negative
"There's barely anything connecting this to the Addams, just the name. Characters outside of Wednesday are boring. And on top of that it's just a bunch of teenage supernatural drama cliches and tropes we've seen already for over 10 years now.  This feels like it was another show and Netflix decided to attach an IP to it to make it sell better. Pretty common nowadays but disappointed that this is from Burton. Most of his other fish out of water movies work so much better since there is more to the characters.  I don't know, maybe I'm the wrong demographic for this or I'm looking at it the wrong way.",7,neutral

"You'll like this if you liked ""Chilling Adventures of Sabrina"", ""Riverdale"", and other cookie-cutter CW supernatural teen dramas. I'm not personally a fan of those shows, but I have seen them and can confirm that the plot of Wednesday is simply a reorganized retelling of plot-lines from those shows.  Although I didn't like the show, I know not everything is meant to appeal to everyone and so I'd rather give a mostly optimistic review for my negative experience. Some of the few ways this show exceeds those other teen dramas, is the show knowing it's simplicity, the devotion to the autumn aesthetic, some songs that are overplayed in mainstream movies but they're still good songs, and giving us a slightly different protagonist even if it's a very basic Gothic ""weird girl"" type. I can't make this review without talking about the writing, and I simply can't sugar-coat how awful the writing is. It felt like the writers intentionally inserted cliche phrases, barely researched concepts, and googled ""uncommon words"" to over-complicate very basic terms which just stood out. They put all of that into the script like a madlibs game, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and excuse it as a maybe rushed project. With how horrible the writing was, I'd like to focus the attention on how Jenna carries the bad dialogue and softens the blow making it seem not so bad with some of her delivery. She does her best to make up for the incompetent writers who did a horrible job, but she in her role, couldn't fix their short-comings. The bad writing is more apparent in the side characters who truly feel like extras due to how little character they have. Even the love interest has the personality of a plank of wood so when the forced relationship happens, the protagonist just increasingly looks dumb. There's so much more I can rant about, but I feel like I got my main conspicuous complaints off my chest.",1,negative
"Here's my updated review after the conclusion of season 3.  Season 3 was mediocre in my opinion. I think my outlook on Star Wars projects has changed since I watched Andor. Most things have paled in comparison to the magnificence of that show.  Seasons 1 and 2 weren't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but they were still very entertaining. The latter was entertaining as well, but I probably won't ever watch the episodes again because they aren't too groundbreaking.  Season 1 was a mostly down to earth weekly bounty hunter show. It was a solid start.  Season 2 had some cool cameos that mostly worked for the progression. It was great.  Season 3 saw a great fall in quality. It was disjointed and flawed. Not terrible, but disappointing.  If there is a season 4 I hope it can give us a compelling finish. M.",7,neutral
"I was a big Addams family fan growing up, could even say Christina Ricci's Wednesday might even have been my first ever crush, i was excited by the trailer and have been looking to see how the show turned out. I have to say i was very amused with this show. Jenna Ortega nails Wednesday maybe even more than Christina Ricci did. Great story keeps you guessing untill the end. Great supporting characters wasn't sure about it at first but its really well done. Some great cameo's and good choice for Gomez and Morticia too. There's room for more let's just hope it's as well thought out as this one can't wait to see more.",8,positive
"Season 2: 8-Stars This season dramatically improved on the first. The actual show follows closer to the books/games and we see more of a stronger development on characters of Ciri and Geralt and their relationship (father/daughter-esque) which feel more akin to the where we're at in the games or at least just before. We even get more monsters and more of those Witcher battles using tactics from the games and books like smelling salts, potions, magic, etc. THIS FEELS LIKE THE WITCHER. My only issue is that the season is too damn short and I don't want to wait another 2 years for more of the story to develop.  Season 1: 1-Star Basically a Xena: Warrior Princess with Witcher in the main role. It's literally on the same level with effects as a 20 year old syndicated series. Now before anyone says ""Well this doesn't have the same budget as GoT"" Oh... yes it certainly does/did. GoT capped out at $10mil an episode by the final seasons, up from $4-6 mil, where as Witcher is starting at $10mil right off the bat. So why does this look mediocre in comparison? Cavill is a perfect Geralt, no doubt there, but Triss and Yen are horribly cast compared to the only other visual representations we've been canonically given (the games). It would've been nice to see some similarities between the game characters and their on-screen counterparts, but I guess they got Yen's hair color right... at least. The script writing is dreadful, pacing is slow and dull at times. Enough to make you realize how bored you are with the current scene, vs a comparable series like Game of Thrones that kept the pacing steady and the action consistent. I was somewhat reserved going into this show, simply because I didn't want to compare it to Game of Thrones all the way through, even through reviewer sites prior to its release claimed it would dethrone GoT and surpass it, but I'm definitely not seeing it happening. I have no loyalties to any of the characters besides Geralt, which shouldn't be when we're being spoon-fed three different timelines with three different focal point characters that overlap each other depending on episodes. If season two is bound to happen, they need to go back and read the books again, maybe play through the games. Ditch the cheap effects, and work out the budget a bit better to provide more of a ""witcher"" atmosphere. Using strobe lights through windows as a stand in for lightning, and a big flood light behind a character to portray some sort of dramatic build up is cheesy garbage I'd expect from a 1990's daytime drama. I know I'm focusing a lot on the low quality effects effort, but I felt like this was the weakest point of the whole series and needs definite work if I'm going to bother sitting through another slew of episodes next year.",6,neutral

"Love the show, very Burton-esque. However, while Catherine Zeta-Jones looks fantastic, I couldn't get past how ridiculous it is given her age that she's cast as a parent of young teens. Both parents' acting was robotic and awkwardly timed. Christina Ricci's acting was also bad.  That said, the rest of the cast is stellar and I love the complex storylines and character development of many of the students and townspeople. The cinematography, music, and dark humor are on point.  They did a great job setting the foundation for this to be a multi-season show with plenty of mysteries and crimes to explore down the road. Definitely worth watching!",9,positive
"Ok, so we have Wednesday Addams - from the Addams family who is meeting vampires and werewolves etc in a teenage drama/detective mystery in a Hogwarts/Veronica Mars/Riverdale setting. Wednesday begins to have visions, becomes an amateur detective in a murder mystery, gets drawn into a love triangle, and learns to socialize. So teenage drama.  This is not necessary a bad idea though - the original series basically had one pitch only. The Addams family is an family where every-thing is the opposite of what is expected. They hate cute, nice things like dogs and happyness and love vile, strange things like torture, swamps, depression and dangerous beasts. The creepy and the kooky but also the dangerous (even if the 60s show in general was a bit tame) and every episode had normal society interact with them in some way. This was followed by the later 90s movies - movies with great actors but with a script that was a bit so-so and too much focus on Fester. In short - Addams need to branch out a bit.  In this spin-off, Wednesday is getting the focus due to the characters popularity from Christinas Riccis acting in said 90s movies. She has clearly grown to high school age (she was very young in the 60s show and very underused) and is enrolling in a Hogwarts like place for freaks and outcasts. Again not a bad idea. However, while I get that they want to focus more on the sarcastic and antisocial parts of the Addams brand, the character was also sadistic and death-obsessed. The initial Piranha scene works well, but then she becomes way too sympathetic. Not necessary a huge problem, but her Addams Root is weakened - you could have simply invent a new girl, remove the Addams name entirely and go for that. In addition, the script in general is pretty weak. Its a bit too generic, too YA for it to really work. They should allow more gore, maybe letting Wednesday murder, torture or maim a classmate or something. I get that you could call it growth - but I am not sure I want to see her character evolve that much. In some episodes she is joined by other members of the family, but their scenes are mostly forgettable. The show is not about the family.  However, this is saved by in general good acting and a pretty decent Tim Burton aesthetic. I would call it amazing, buts decent and cute and that can be enough. Just don´t do in expecting something really creative and unique here and if you are a hardcore Addams fan, you might want to skip this completely, since the focus isn´t really on the family and their kookyness. But it is very charming and that can be enough.",10,positive
"The fact that this series spawned about a thousand new barber shops tells you all you need to know....  The thing is, I know lots of people, Brummies too, who absolutely LOVE this - and good luck to them. Perhaps that's why I've tried with it, and tried at least three times, but it's just not working for me - because it's just not good enough.  Yes, it's visually striking and the soundtrack is great, and yes, some of the performances are brilliant.  BUT...  1. The accents are pretty bad - as someone local to Brum it makes me wince every time they open their mouths.  2. The language is anachronistic. Yes, they were rough, but this is a 21st century spin on how people spoke a full 100 years ago, and it jars.  3. It's gratuitously violent. Yes yes, I know it's a story about violent gangs, but at times it's a proper gore-fest and hard to watch. 'Gritty realism' doesn't revel in brutality.  4. It glamourises some really seedy and unpleasant characters, putting them on a pedestal, making them into flawed but ultimately honourable anti-heroes. Yeah right. Life would have been nasty, brutish and short - and utterly devoid of rough-hewn glamour, or a cool soundtrack.  5. Worst of all, it buys into its own hype. At times iit's like watching an hour long pop video with a smattering of dialogue here and there and a few punch ups. How silly and puffed up it all is.  I give up. I'm off to watch 'The Godfather'.",10,positive

"I just don't see the point of this series; through two seasons, I have yet to find any redeeming qualities. A less-than-stellar foray into television's two-decades-long obsession with the antihero, ""Yellowstone"" features a collection of dull-witted characters whose personalities range from awful to detestable. This in and of itself would not necessarily be a deal-breaker, if the series were as smart as, say, ""Succession."" Instead, the plot is so utterly predictable as to be groan-inducing, and there is no wry commentary to be found upon the manifold frailties of mankind. It's just all obvious and empty. But, hey, the scenery is gorgeous.",1,negative
Absolutely love this series. Usually i don't watch series like these but seeing this on trending got me interested.orignally i thought it was some same old teenage love stories i would expect from Netflix but nooo! It turned out to be completely diffrent.overall the story was pretty good and simple. The acting was iceing on the top. Jenna Ortega and other cast did their best. Was pretty unique and was dark.

I can't believe people are giving it a higher rating then 1. It was abysmal. Just don't get it at all. Strange, weird and boring all rolled into one. Just left confused at how such a bad showed could be made. Just totally in disbelief how bad it was and mad at the time wasted on it. Thought it would get better but only got worse. Avoid at all costs.",10,positive
"Andor is why I pay my Disney+ subscription. This is Star Wars for those who have grown up with the franchise and are yearning for a more mature take on the Universe. It's hard to use the work 'realistic' when it comes to sci-fi, but everything about Andor feels real. The characters act sensibly and their actions never feel like they are purely made to drive the plot forward. I think the last time I used the term 'sci-fi that transcends it's boundary' was when talking about Battlestar Galactica. I think I can safely use that term here too. It's not a action sci-fi, so it's audience it probably smaller, so I hope it will not get cancelled. I hope Disney can find the courage to front a show based on quality and not just audience numbers. I believe that quality shows will always be good revenue earners over time as they are appreciated by more people, even if they are not the most popular out of the box.",9,positive
"The first two episodes were great, but then it focused more on the drama than actually making showing some action. A show who doesn't have action, especially a ""infected"" people type of show should have that, otherwise it gets boring.  I dont wanna use the word ""zombie"" 'cause it isnt all about that, but anyway even movies such as World War Z had some action paced scenes that made you focus on the plot more and keep you seated.  I really wanted to like it, but it doesn't even come close to the shows that have been #1 in here, such as GOT or BreakingBad. Currently missing the last 2 episodes of the series but I dont think they will make such a big difference. Such a let down.",10,positive

"As societies evolve, many practices, ideas, and beliefs, diminish or vanish. Here, we have an advanced society being replaced by a primitive society. Yes, a dystopian society, but a society using the stupid beliefs which we should be ridding ourselves of, and using them to enforce new practices for living. I'm very excited to see where this show goes. Who is behind it? How did they manage to get so many men to think backwards? Brainwashing? Electroconvulsive treatment? These are English speaking, intelligent men with very stupid beliefs running this community!!",6,neutral

"I enjoyed this adaptation. I liked the actress, and her characterization, but I found a lot of it tropey and predictable. I feel like all the characters were a little off. Wednesday is her dark self with a dry sarcastic air. She's supposed to grapple with her lack of care for others, but it gets to a point where I don't even know why the other characters like her.  The whole plot line around her parents felt pointless and completely mismatched their characters. Like, this is the Adams family. They are morbid and kooky, so why is morbidity a surprise from them? What, is it so Wednesday is the darkest specialist of them all?  They do the same with the academy she attends. There are things that occur that, to the other supernatural kids, should be normal if not welcome. But they often act exactly like normal people when something supernatural happens. It all feels like they are putting down the other characters so Wednesday can be the unique one.  It leaves the cast pretty weak to make her stand out. But you shouldn't break down the cast in order to build up your protagonist. There's the making of a good character stuffed into a show about school drama and weak mystery, which feels quite mediocre for what the character deserves.  Unfortunately, it has that Netflix feeling. That lacking blandness that bleeds around the good elements. I like it purely for Wednesday, but the rest is so mediocre.",7,neutral
"I'm not sure how anyone could not like this show. Its the best show Ive seen in years. Reading the negative reviews I see a pattern of people complaining about unrealistic horsemanship, calfs being born, ect. Ive farmed/ranched my whole life abd none of this even crossed my mind. Its realistic enough for the general viewer and none of that stuff is pertinent to the story unless you are just looking for reasons to not like the series. The story line keeps you on the edge of your seat, you never know whats going to happen next. In fact if I had any complaints it would be that there is too much going on with each character. makes me wonder if they will have enough future material with it all coming at breakneck speed. The scenery, music, acting are all top notch. In the later episodes I like how they are going back in time to show the characters at a younger age and I cant wait to see more of that. This is as good as it gets in my opinion and cant wait for season 2 Hopefully the wait wont be long and there will be more episodes.",1,negative
"The Last of Us is a gripping and emotionally charged post-apocalyptic series that stands out as a truly exceptional piece of storytelling. The series follows the journey of Joel and Ellie, two survivors of a fungal pandemic that has ravaged the world and left humanity on the brink of extinction.  The writing is phenomenal, with complex and well-developed characters that are both relatable and flawed. The series delves deep into themes of morality, survival, and the human condition, creating a story that is both thrilling and thought-provoking.  The acting is superb, with outstanding performances from both the lead actors and supporting cast. The chemistry between Joel and Ellie is particularly strong, and the relationship that develops between them is both heartwarming and heartbreaking.  The production design and cinematography are also top-notch, with a hauntingly beautiful and desolate world brought to life in stunning detail. The score is equally impressive, adding an extra layer of emotional depth to the already powerful story.  Overall, ""The Last of Us"" is a triumph of storytelling and an instant classic in the world of television. It is a must-watch for fans of post-apocalyptic fiction and anyone looking for a powerful and emotional journey.",10,positive
"Finally a guy who looks like you don't mess with him. The movies were horribly miscast. I mean Tom Cruise wears inserts in his shoes so he looks taller.... He isn't. He also isn't imposing or looking anything like the character he portrayed. Alan Ritchson nails the role, the writers and directors got what Lee Childs wrote in his books. Binged season 1 chowed down popcorn and was glued to the set. Season 2 is great so far I like the direction this series is going in. The good guy goes after corruption and scumbags what what we as an audience wish we could do if given the opportunity. Heard they are already filming season 3 , best Christmas gift I got this year. Cheers.",8,positive
"Show starts out really well - not just potentially promising, but actually has one of the best pilot episodes in TV. Acting, cast, CGI, everything is great, including the fast pace of the show.  However, starting pretty much right after, that quality begins to drop. Perhaps not much at first, but enough to notice - not an issue yet as the show is still very entertaining. The issue, though, is that the same trend persists as we get more episodes, and now nearing the end of the first season, I have to say that close to half the show has been totally pointless, to the point that the good is beginning to have a hard time making up for it. We literally get entire episodes (and yeah - plural) of filler, flash backs of character history that consists of pointless interactions and dialogues between them which actually seemingly add nothing to the show or it's character development. What's also interesting is that in contrast to the beginning of the season, the show now is taking place in far more boring (now almost always indoor) locations.  I hope they turn it around some, because at this rate they'll fall below the quality of the later TWD episodes, already in their first season.",7,neutral
"It takes a while for the series to really grab you. Especially the second season is incredibly long and often boring.  In seasons 1 and 2, there are far too many scenes that were shot for far too long and are completely superfluous. Furthermore, the protagonist's face is constantly zoomed in, which gets very annoying at some point.  In addition, it is unfortunately never explained how this regime came about and it also seems extremely unrealistic.  Nevertheless, the series is very often extremely exciting and especially season 3 has convinced me very much. The development of the characters is exciting to watch. Despite initial difficulties, I am now looking forward to season 4.",9,positive

"First of all, please forget about the game ""The Last of Us"".  I understand that a movie is not a game, and cannot and should not be.  In this case, the creators cannot be faulted.  This series had so much potential to become a Memorable series.  But HBO has squandered almost all of that potential, except for its beautiful, post-apocalyptic world.  The creators have beautifully created this ruined world and its creatures, and one of the most enjoyable experiences of this series are the locations and creatures of this world. In this case, season one is much better.  Another valuable point of this series is the powerful acting of Pedro Pascal and Anna Torv(short time). Among the very weak actors and their bad performances, only Pedro Pascal makes the rest of the bad performances less noticeable, and this advantage was also lost in the second season.  And the choice of Bella Ramsey is the worst possible choice among the other bad actors in the series.  Maybe she's a good actress, but not here.  The story of the series, to some extent, is not what it pretends to be.  The series could be renamed ""The Passion of a Lesbian"".  The creators have ruined this series, like the ruined world of ""The Last of Us""",10,positive
"After all the online hype about this show I decided to give it a go. My review is for season 1 only...not sure if I will venture into Season 2. I can see why some people think it is all the rage, and also see why others are not all that impressed. I would probably rate is 6.5 if there were half numbers as a 7 on my scale usually means I would recommend it to friends without any preamble. For most people I know this show would require some pretext. No spoilers here.  In short there is nothing new here that hasn't been done before so unless you are Rip Van Winkle and missed the last 15 years or so you will not be shocked by any of the scenarios playing out. That being said the production values are good and this would be a great glossy packaged summary of a lot of the ""edgy"" events presented while Rip was sleeping.  I entered the series paying close attention to details and storylines, then found I didn't really need to after a while....stories were familiar, pacing was somewhat slow and the Soundtrack was cool, original and interesting at the beginning, but became annoying as the episodes advanced. For some strange reason the soundtrack matched the storyline and felt like it was suggesting how I should react or feel...fine to be supportive of a story but it became intrusive. Your mileage may vary.  In summary, the first couple episodes were interesting, the middle slow and the last episode a saving grace. Cut 1 or 2 hours out of this and I would rate it higher...and change up the soundtrack more often.  A glossy show that might be your cup of tea...I think it could have done better.  Season 2 Update  OK I decided to watch Season two with a friend who had not seen season one. I must say a vast improvement over season one...the script flowed better, the music was varied and the show didn't come off quite so pretentious. Some familiar actors from other shows that I have watched and enjoyed made it more entertaining.  I would give season 2 a rating of 8 for good entertainment.  Season One - 6.5/10.  Season Two - 8 Wish IMDB allowed half point ratings - overall a 7.5.",7,neutral
For once a good addition to the Star Wars Universe. The show so far has had twists and turns and remained loyal to the source material. Disney hit a home run with this but subsequently messed it up with the following two shows since (Boba Fett and Obi-wan Kenobi) like they had with the last three movies.,10,positive

Okay, so the TV hero is a bit pumped up, but what the heck, that's how he was supposed to be portrayed, And yes, he's a bit wooden, but aren't big muscly guys a bit wooden in real life?  I enjoyed series 1, and I'm enjoying series 2, long may they continue to make the TV versions - so far there are about 16 books, so the cast has lots of work going forward.  In case you're wondering, I don't care that they don't follow correct procedures or rules or stuff like that, I enjoy Reacher purely for its entertainment value - for me, that's what Reacher is all about.",6,neutral

"The Handmaid's Tale was one of the most acclaimed series of 2017, with a score of 92 on the metacritic and considered by many to be the best series of 2017, and which ended up winning the emmy for best drama series and a few other awards, the series history is After a terrorist attack reaps the lives of the President of the United States and a large number of other elected politicians, a Catholic faction takes power with the stated intention of restoring peace. The group transforms the country into the Republic of Gilead, establishing a totalitarian regime based on the laws of the old testament, removing the rights of minorities and women in particular. In the midst of all this, Offred is a ""handmaid"", that is, a woman whose sole purpose is to procreate to maintain the demographic levels of the population. In its third assignment, it is given to the Commander, a high ranking officer of the regime, and the relationship goes out of the way planned by the system, the story is interesting and very sad, the series is slow, there are episodes that many people will find tiresome , obviously is not a series for people who only likes action series, because The Handmaid's Tale is a very dramatic series with a delicate subject, photography is beautiful, the costumes are great and the performances are great, highlight for Elisabeth Moss who is impeccable in the role of Offred, is a character who suffers greatly in the series, and you feel for the character, The Handmaid's Tale aborts a delicate subject with great performances, a well directed series, is a bit slow, but has great performances, worth It's too much to watch.

"First off all Cole Hauser is awsome in this. Had to be said?? and Costner was born to play a grumpy cowboy. Pretty much all the actors in this show does a great job, proberbly why it's so good, if i had to highlight another actor, it has to be Kelly Reilly she plays her role to perfection. I don't know if it's just me, but It kinda reminds me of a cowboy version of sons of anarchy, and I mean that as a compliment. All in all a show worth watching.",8,positive
"I am thrilled!! Jenna Ortega was born to play Wednesday!! I am an 80's kid, so I was unsure what to expect. Christina Ricci was a great Wednesday. But Jenna Ortega completely crushed it. She is an amazing actress. I dont even cate about the story of the series because i am so blowen away by her owning the character Wednesday. In genereal i think the cast is just great!! In every aspect. I don't understand the critics towards Luis Guzman and Catherine Zeta-Jones. I think they act great together, and I can really feel the vibe between them. I also always pictured Gomez as an very attractive charming person, but Guzman is just adorable and plays a great act.  It's fun watching Jenna! Great show!",9,positive
"The Last of Us series had potential, especially in its first season, which effectively captured the emotional tone and world-building of the game. However, it was bogged down by unnecessary filler episodes and an oddly persistent focus on character sexuality-particularly Ellie's at a young age-which felt out of place and detracted from the core narrative.  The second season continues this trend, with even more filler and another romance arc for Ellie that, while more appropriate given her age, still feels forced and lacking in emotional payoff. While there are impactful moments scattered throughout both seasons, they're often buried under extended, unnecessary scenes that drag the pacing and dull the show's overall impact.  Hopefully things find a good pace as the series continues.",10,positive
"I'm giving it a 10/10. Sure some things were predictable, but you can't deny this series was seriously good. The casting/acting, the plot, it all worked so well. I really enjoyed Jenna's portrayal of Wednesday. She did a wonderful job. I loved how prominent ""thing"" was. I loved the no bs lines & subtle inclusiveness that allows this show to reach a wider audience. Plus throw a classic love triangle in the mix and I'm hooked. I wish there was a little more of morticia and Gomez, but alas this is called ""Wednesday"" for a reason. I really hope this gets a second season! It's definitely great as a stand-alone, but with how well it's already been received, I think a second season is well deserved. Another win for Tim burton in my book!!",9,positive
"I had put off watching The White Lotus for awhile, however when I finally sat down to watch it, I binge watched Season 1 and 2 within a couple of days.  I would have to say that I preferred season 1 over season 2. I think that is because it felt a little more quirky and a novelty.  I love how each season opens up and then goes back in time. It definitely has you on your toes and guessing as to what is going on. I'm usually pretty good at guessing who done its, though this show is a who done it with a twist.  The cast have been brilliant in each series.  I am really looking forward to season 3. The great thing about the premise for this show is that it can keep going, different locations, different guests, different murders.  If you are looking for your next binge series, then this is definitely worth watching.",2,negative
"Season 1 and 2 were so good. A very good plot, actors were good, unexpected plot twists. They could have ended this show with wrapping up in season 3 and that's it!! However they chose to milk it out. Starting from season 3, things started to get worse and worse!! So boring and long scenes. Ridiculous irrational story line. Things started to get out the writer's hand!! Very long zoomed in silent scenes on June's face without any reason. Each episode now has 5 minutes of important events and the rest is just june's face doing weird facial expressions.  This show made me hate elizabeth moss like i would never ever watch another show for this actress.  And they are even renewing this show for a 6th season!!",10,positive

"After watching the 36 episodes of 'The Handmaid's Tale' I can safely say that THIS is a real horror story. After each episode I find myself dazed , often with tears in my eyes and that is the truth . With that said the story and character arc's are so good it is worth the melancholy emotion. I understand how the dismal tail won 8 Emmies for a TV series . There is all - love, drama, thriller, sex combined in a very unexpected way. It doesn't have a thing you'd like to throw away from the film. It's complete and organic. Our days TV shows has grown in something bigger. It became a real movie with a row of episodes. Definitely new era in filming. 'The Handmaids Tale' is a compelling, albeit extreme, experience of sexism, sadism, and the triumph of the human spirit. The story line, set in the future, reminds me of the holocaust in its other worldly ""how on earth did this happen"" perspective. I couldn't stop watching it! Excellent must see program.",6,neutral

If I could nominate this for an award I 100% would. There is only one thing that is a downer on this series is the introduction to the show which is below par and not up to scratch. However I believe that the rest of the season makes up for it, especially the ending which I would had never guessed and is an ultimate finish to one of the best and most creative bits of work that Tim burton has produced, if it were not for the beginning i believe more people would have watched and I personally would give it 10/10.",7,neutral
"I won't go on about the previous seasons as its like an old bottle of whiskey, freakishly smooth and stylish, and in this case era defining; what a journey it has been.  Having the same expectations, if not more, the final season was expected to do justice to say the least; however, it is quite shockingly shallow even when it constantly tries to dig unecessary depth. All those character developments, the defining qualities and plot coherence have been smoked up.  This fine whiskey might have just left a surprisingly unpleasant hangover, shame.",10,positive

This last episode has given me enough reason to cancel my Disney subscription. Disney stuff is not for everyone anymore and that's ok. This show has taken a completely different direction. It became very apparent earlier this season that the protagonist is becoming a side character. Does baby Yoda purr? He did for Lizzo for some reason. Did she direct this episode because it feels like she might have. And Jack Black.. well Jack Black is just Jack Black (or also possibly the director). Disney is not capable of releasing quality original content and is systematically dismantling the shows that did work. Might be a good time to sell that stock if you have any because oof.,5,neutral
"I like how they created a series that is both funny and dark at the same time. For me, the cast, the setting, the story to the thriller vibes remind me a lot of the magic world of Harry Potter. I think that the involvement of Tim Burton only makes things even better, and from now on I can't think of another perfect fit for playing Wednesday other than Jenna; she's just perfect. I like the little details like the window in Wednesday's room. It's a relief to see that Netflix can still pull off a good series like this one, and, I can't wait for the new seasons to come, and I think the darker the story gets, the better it will be.",10,positive

"Aside from some Questionable Casting Choices, I was looking forward to this show. Within 5 minutes I knew I had to throw out any preconcieved notions I may have had about the Addam's family and take this show on its own. None of that is why I have so many problems with this show.  This feels like a poorly written cliche New Student at High School complete with Alternagirl being forcibly paired with the Preppy Blond, who gives her a tour of campus complete with ""These are the different cliques and this is what you should think about them, oh and there's the Evil Prom Queen. No one will ever beat her"" to Alternagirl bonds with guy from group she's told to stay away from. And an obvious set up for a love triangle.  They might as well and written the script in crayons. The lines for these characters have al been heard before in ""Insert Random TEEN Drama Here"" and brings nothing to the table. They arent even utilized in any creative way.  The concept and plot points make no sense. She is being sent to a school for Misfit Children who are different, but the school social dynamics and personalities are EXACTLY the same that have been presented at every High School Set Movie or TV show since Grease! Or even earlier. Outcadt in Name only. Everyone Magically Knows Fencing, Which Brings me to my next point of contention.  Wednesday, the central Character (Duh) is presented as someone with a high knowledge base, high level of skill in Escape, Planning, Manipulation, Subterfuge, Fencing (?), Super-Negativity and Non-Conformity. But in her first Escape attempt she fails to consider that making a scene with the Kindergarten Quality Townie Bullies might work against her? That makes no sense. Wednesday's dynamic with her mother Morticia also makes no sense, NOR does the cringey Nick Name Gomez decides to give Morticia. No Itteration of Morticia would EVER deign to be called ""Tish"" WHAT?!  Jenna Ortega fails to bring anything new to a character and instead simply copies Christina Ricci's take. Ricci's take was far scarier and leaned heavily on dead-pan delivery than the original TV show. Ortega just does more of the same. I suppose if you think someone can be Star Quality at singing Karaoke, you could enjoy her performance here.  On top of my small personal Petty Complaints (The Gomez casting decision, that Kid from ""The Gifted"" who just grates my nerves) All of this together makes the show UNWATCHABLE!",10,positive

They wouldn't know good humor action and drama if it hit them over the head. I don't mean the actual story line however I have watched Dallas and this isn't even close to it. This is an epic modern day Western even if the town itself is behind the times. And remember this is TV. If you're looking for reality watch reality TV. The grit of these cowboys and even the Indians is absolutely fantastic. I love every second of this show. No it's not Disney but I find it closer to a lot of family situations than many other shows. I may not dig the political views of a lot of Hollywood actors but I am still glad to see they can produce something interesting and gritty these days without it having to have weed or some other drug as the center of the story.,8,positive
Ok I'm not a fan of cussing at all so I admit the language is not needed! However we absolutely love this show. If you don't find it entertaining there is something wrong. It's just a show! The acting is absolutely amazing! They could not have picked a better cast! John's part and Kaycee's part are played so well that you feel like your right there in the show. And Beth well if you find her acting bad then I'd hate to know what you think is good acting! I don't support murder or cussing and certainly don't do either one but if you mess with my family I promise I am Beth 100 percent! This is just a show it's entertainment and it is definitely well acted and well scripted minus the cussing and murder. However self defense is absolutely needed! The family may have their faults and do inappropriate things from time to time but it beats watching a lot of the pure trash on TV these days! And no family is perfect and gets along all the time so you can't say the Dutton's aren't a normal family because all families have their issues and there's always that one black sheep!,8,positive

I've watched this series 3 times now and still laugh out loud at the antics of Wednesday played brilliantly by Jenna Ortega. All the characters are well played and there is not a person out of place in this production. It was great to see Gwendoline Christie playing a completely different character than Briene of Tart in the wonderful Game of Thrones, she as all of her fellow actors absolutely nailed it. I'm hoping that there will be another series of this fantastic show. Well done Netflix, an absolute triumph.",5,neutral

I mean, 1920s England. You can smell out horses while watching. And of course costumes... I admired. Cillian Murphy is captivating and lights out as Thomas Shelby.

They all add to this perfectly cast, total classic British tv at its absolute best.  I'm only on series two but I'm seriously hooked and should finish before the month is out if I can manage to let myself watch just the one episode a day.  Along with millions I'm sure, I love Tommy and every scene he is in he completely commands your attention. The same with Polly and the captivating Grace and May.

It keeps you engaged and excited to continue holding on to further episodes and I'm over-excited to give u a spoiler but I'm containing myself. The length of this series is quite sized so two sitting will be enough to complete the full length. So, hurry up, hope you enjoy this.....",8,positive
"I'm on the love it side. I've played both games and absolutely love the story in addition to the fun game play. I honestly didn't think a show was necessary because the game already felt like an interactive movie, but after watching the show I thoroughly.enjoy the real life adaptation. I like that it follows the game.closely while taking some deviations. I've read a few people's reviews about the filler episodes 3 and 7 and completely understand why some feel that way, but again having played the games those episodes aren't just fillers as they fill in important backstories to know these characters even more. So I applaud the show for investing time into who the characters while perhaps sacrificing some action. That being the other criticism I've seen....where are the zombies!! I'd be lying if I didn't want to feel the intensity of more clickers roaming around, but on the other hand, each scene with the fungal.zombies feels that much more interesting.  For.those looking for a slower pace drama that takes time to develop the characters for what i will expect will be a huge payback if the show continues to follow the game, then you will likely enjoy The Last oF Us. It's not a perfect show, but despite the faults it has, it's still a very well done and interesting show that stays true to its source material.",10,positive
"The show makes you feel the full continuity of the human condition. I am begging you to watch this and all its entirety to understand the characters to understand what it meant to be part of a rebellion the hard decisions you had to make for the utilitarian great or good versus hurting your own friends and family the actual decisions, you have to make the grimness and war, and the storytelling the art, the scale of the show the architecture everything just leads to one cohesive beauty that is and/or and especially in season two. Not as flash she is season one, but the architecture is on a different skill. The storytelling is on another level.",6,neutral

"Me and my wife watched this show together and the fact we were both so interested in the same show really speaks to how good it is! The zombie sci fi violence is only a part of the show, with the real life problems of living in such an apocalypse really being the focus of this show. Constantly reminded that people are worse than the ""clickers"", this show really sets itself apart from the walking dead and other survival stories. The relationship of Pedro Pescal and Belle Ramsey is just so heartfelt even from the very begining, both of these actors deserve awards for their roles. Also there is an episode in this show that tells a love story so beautiful that you know it cant end well in this terrible world, and it is truly one of the best things we have ever watched together.",6,neutral
"After acting like a grown adult, and giving the show a run through, i'm hooked. Jenna Ortega quickly takes on the role of this reimagining.  Her delivery of the beloved character is definitely her own, but just as entertaining. She's quirky, strange, and dark humored just as anyone would expect. There are some cheese moments but then again so did the original Addams family material.  In a way, it's refreshing that the show runners didn't take this the full brooding, dark, and insincere serious tone that a lot our other childhood favorite comics or original films have opted for as of recent.  Definitely give yourself an episode or two acclimate. It'll feel just right in not time at all.",10,positive
"In a world that resembles ""Children of Men"", tormented with ecological disasters and a vision of human extinction - there is a country where citizens decided to take strong actions to prevent from the vision of the grim future. Men are put in charge and women are relieved from their constitution and freedom rights to serve for one purpose only - giving birth to children in a utopian society that follows the rules of Bible. But this show is not just about this - but most of all - it's a study of how a totalitarian regime is born. How a simple and dangerous idea is pushed from the deepest parts of frustrated minds to become a basis for a new society whose happiness is assured by rifles, severe punishments, eradication of basic education and fellings - a society free of any critic thinking, fully devoted to the state. Where fear is the main tool to keep the state united. But like any totalitarian regime - it also starts to eat it's own founders. It's a study of how ordinary people are being corrupted when given absolute power. And it's a study of people who can't stand up and agree to become victims of the cruel ideology. Sounds familiar? This is the show that will help just a little understand the history of the 20th century.",10,positive
"The greatest television show of all time so far.  The layers and nuances are beyond anything I've ever seen. Each character, how they interact with each other, how the story unfolds as a result and amplifies all these elements... It's incomparable.  Each series is a cascade of layers that increasingly reveals more and more about each character until we reach the core. It's an elaborate morality tale, the characters serving as cautionary tales that allow the audience to look inward.  Do you see yourself in these characters? Let's hope so. That's where the opportunity for growth lies.  Anyone who reduces this to ""cringe"" or says the characters are ""so unlikable"" is only speaking to their own stupidity. This is Shakespeare in America.",6,neutral
"This show is great - it's dark, funny, violent, serious, and silly. Cavill is definitely enjoying himself as The Witcher and carries most of the scenes he is in. Chalota's portrayal of femme fatale Yennefer is also enjoyable.  There's plenty of content left from the Sapkowski books and the CDPR games so here's hoping for 6 seasons and a movie!",10,positive
"I have thoroughly enjoyed all the seasons and episodes so far. The character development really keeps me intrigued. One episode you don't like one character, and the next episode you suddenly have a soft spot for them. They are very dynamic and complicated. Very human. The casting is really incredible.  The audio and visuals are also a delight. The show really draws you in. I always want to go stay at ""the white lotus"" until I don't. They do a wonderful job at making you feel like you're at each location they shoot at.  Lastly, I love that the seasons loosely tie into each other, but you can also just watch each on their own.",10,positive
"I didn't really fancy this series, but then started hearing a lot of good things about it, so decided to try it.  After an ok start, each episode grabbed me more and more and culminated in a fantastic last episode.  Jenna Ortega was absolutely brilliant as the lead character. Her dance scene is up there with tv gold moments. She seems born to play this role.  The premise had me intrigued. A school for misfits all with their own special powers, and a monster killer on the loose. It was a real whodunnit which had us guessing right up until the last minute.  A great cast and great characters and clearly a lot of effort in put in to the story and script. Plus a top director on board, and what you get is a quality, very entertaining new franchise.",10,positive
"Not only did they put together a brilliant cast but the story from day 1 just makes you want to keep watching and always is a step ahead of what you think  The way through the series you slowly get each characters back story was brilliant and makes you like them even more, even the characters that don't have long parts still perform amazing  As soon as I stopped watching it I just was like when will we get another series as good as this with the story and cast being so good  This deserves every good review and I highly recommend anyone to watch it  Seeing them do another season would be brilliant.",10,positive
The show is so similar to the game but still has time to add more details. It also doesn't track off of the main reasoning of the game and stays on topic all of the time. It's so compelling and shows how hard it is for a dad that lost a daughter to live on in a world with many losses. Also the actors are amazing. They are so good at giving emotions and keep giving action. The VFX is also really good. Many explosions where made really good. This show is just amazing I think of you like zombie apocalypse movies and shows. Or just like this game I suggest you watch this. No wonder it got 9.5. Can't wait for new episodes!,7,neutral
"A mediocre book gave way for a very well sold video game that remarked itself with very good graphics, maybe the best in its league at the time. The series is about the same: good looks, vague traces of brain.  Opening scene. Calm. A deer drinks water. But, oh, it seems there was a battle between some sort of skeleton spider and some guy. The guy is very strong, so he drops his sword and barely gets it back at the third attempt. Lucky for him, the spider is not smart enough to understand that the sword that already cut two of his legs might kill it. After the killing, the guy gets out calm and his well : fresh makeup, nicely combed hair.  Next scene. The guy from scene one is in a much poor shape, probably to make a good impression he has his hair in all directions and covers his armor. He is a guy that killed that thing in the lake. And by his calm, he has killed far bigger beasts. But a villager half his size is ready to get into a fight? And the bar tender who refused to serve him, now politely serves him?  Next he walks down the village. The village is some sort of medieval Paris as there are even more people in the street than in the saloon. And everybody is looking at the guy. Really? He seems to have ridden to the village and even he parked his horse and a monster nearby, but people start noticing him as he walks down the street.  So, in short, it is a much tamer version of a successful HBO show, tamer as in cheaper.",6,neutral
"Ultimately, in season two of White Lotus was extremely disappointing. They had fashioned these characters to where we actually cared about them, and then had them do awful and disappointing things across-the-board. The message of the stories generally were about relationships are at their base just mutual using situations where sometimes one prevails well over the other and other times, relationships are about settling for what you can get.  The decisions that the characters make are seen through the visor of who is being naïve, and who is taking care of that, nativity. In the end, all of the characters suffer that have a naïve trait, and those who are seeking to settle or take advantage of that nativity are shown to triumph across all of the relationships depicted in the show. All of the scenes are well acted and the cast does a great job with the Plot line they are given.  At one time or another all of the characters elicit a visceral reaction to their poor behavior, poor decisions, and sometimes lack of action until it's too late. As a viewer at the end of the episodes, one is left with a feeling of heavy disappointment in the decisions that are made, and the empty relationships all of the characters are left with.  One thing of note is the photography of the spectacular locations. Sicily and other parts used in the filming come off extremely well. One will be tempted to immediately purchase a ticket to Palermo, or to other parts of Sicily to enjoy the combination of ancient architecture and rolling beautiful countryside while mount Etna rumbles above it all.  This well, active drama leaves a thudding emptiness in the viewer like the unsatisfying relationships. Each of the characters is left with as they settle for what they can get or what they can tolerate. This is a great result, because it had to be the aim of the writers, producers and actors. And they deliver.",5,neutral
"It was somewhat entertaining but got less so by the episode with a plot that made little sense and an invincible superhero who is a combination of body by Hulk and mind by Sherlock Holmes.  When Hulk Sherlock isn't finding reasons to take his shirt off (oh no he's bloody or wet or smelly, let's spend a few minutes of TV time on changing clothes!) he goes around starting fights and killing people including shooting them in the back. His cop sidekicks let him run the investigation and loan him guns in case he needs to kill more people.  Also amazing how Reacher keeps his pro bodybuilder form as he never comes near a gym, doesn't do any exercises (other than fighting) and eats whatever he wants. That's real TV magic!  The plot is largely incidental to beating up/smoking bad guys and either too confusing or not explained well enough to make it matter. Counterfeiting something something animal feed something something small town corruption.  I hoped for better given the current 8.2 rating, must be a lot of WWE fans on here.",10,positive
"The Last of Us TV series is finally here and it's absolutely incredible! If you're a fan of the video game series or just love post-apocalyptic stories, then you need to tune in. The series follows the journey of Joel, a smuggler, and Ellie, a teenage girl, as they traverse through a United States ravaged by a fungal pandemic that has turned most of humanity into infected monsters. The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world, where the majority of humanity has been wiped out by a deadly fungus and the survivors are forced to fight for survival in a world overrun by dangerous creatures.  The acting performances by Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie are phenomenal. They both give powerful and emotionally charged performances that capture the essence of the characters from the video game perfectly. The pacing of the series is also on point, with a good balance of action, suspense and character development that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the episodes.  The visual effects are also jaw-dropping, creating a realistic and detailed world that immerses you in the post-apocalyptic setting. The series also explores themes such as the cost of survival, the power of love and sacrifice, and the importance of family and community in a world where humanity is on the brink of extinction.  The second episode aired on July 25th and it picks up right where the first episode left off, with Joel and Ellie continuing their journey. The episode continues to impress with its storytelling, acting performances, and production values, and even introduces new characters and a deeper exploration of the infected.  Overall, The Last of Us TV series is a must-watch and it's not to be missed. It's a perfect blend of action, suspense, and character development that keeps you engaged throughout the episodes. If you haven't watched it yet, don't wait any longer, tune in now.",10,positive
"Great series with solid characters, great acting, and interesting story lines. My two complains are that there are only 6 episodes per season. Then you have to wait for about a year and a half for the next season. Most shows have 12 to 24 episodes in a season. Some countries present 25 to 40 episodes per season, and I am not talking about sitcoms. Even expensive Game of Thrones had 10 episodes. Here is 6 only.",10,positive
"The series ""Peaky Blinders"" is a fascinating journey through time that takes viewers into the criminal world of Birmingham in the 20s of the last century. The Shelby family, despite its populousness and brutality, becomes one of the most influential gangster gangs of the postwar period. This British masterpiece, created by Stephen Knight, does not leave any viewer indifferent and deserves the highest praise. This is not just a story about gangsters, it is a deep dive into the lives of people who survived the horrors of the First World War and are trying to find their place in the world. It has everything: drama, crime, love, betrayal and family.  For example, in one scene, Thomas Shelby (Cillian Murphy) suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and sees hallucinations that show how the war continues to haunt him. The series masterfully combines drama, crime and intrigue. He skillfully reveals the complex relationships within the Shelby family and their interaction with other factions.  * The idea of the series is unique and interesting.  The plot revolves around the Shelby family, who are trying to establish themselves in the criminal world of Birmingham. It is full of unexpected twists, intrigues and mysteries.  * The dialogues in the series are thought out to the smallest detail, they are bright and expressive and correspond to the era in which the action takes place.  * Key actors and their characters:   Cillian Murphy as Thomas Shelby is just wonderful. His character is a complex personality full of contradictions. He is cruel and ruthless, but at the same time he has his own code of honor. The scene in which Thomas Shelby first appears on screen, riding a horse, vividly demonstrates his strength and power, as well as his willingness to use violence.    Paul Anderson as Arthur Shelby also deserves high praise. His hero is the ""grey cardinal"" of the family, who is ready to do anything to protect his loved ones. For example, the story of Arthur Shelby, Thomas's older brother, who suffers from psychological trauma sustained during the war and tries to find himself in the world, is one of the most memorable and emotional storylines of the series.   The scene in which Thomas Shelby and his brother Arthur discuss the death of their mother reveals the complicated relationship between the brothers and their emotional pain.   All the characters are great in their roles, worked out to the smallest detail, their motivations and internal conflicts are convincing. For example, in one of the scenes, Polly Gray (Helen McCrory) says: ""We are not English, we are Shelby."" This phrase reflects the strength and unity of the family.   * Directing work in the series is on top. Each frame is thought out to the smallest detail, creating a unique atmosphere of the era. Anthony Byrne, Colm McCarthy and Tim Milants have created an atmosphere that forces the viewer to sit on the edge of a chair. The scene of a fight between Arthur Shelby and his wife Linda. This scene shows Arthur struggling with his internal conflicts and trying to save his family.  * Script writer and director:  Stephen Knight, Toby Finlay and Stephen Russell have done an incredible job combining dramatic and dynamic scenes. The writers and creators of the series have created vivid and memorable characters and a fascinating plot. One of the scenes, for example, shows a wedding that takes place in the style of the 20s.  * The camerawork in the series is also highly appreciated. Each scene is expertly shot, creating a unique atmosphere and mood. Visually, the series is great. The camera captures every detail, creating an atmosphere of mystery. The scene in which Thomas Shelby meets Detective Chester Campbell (Sam Neill). This scene reveals the complicated relationship between Thomas and the authorities, as well as his willingness to protect his family at all costs.  * The musical accompaniment in the series is performed at a high level. Music plays an important role in the development of the plot and helps to create the right atmosphere. It emphasizes the mood and complements the characters' images. For example, the song ""Red Right Hand"" by Nick Cave perfectly fits the image of Thomas Shelby.  * Editing, frame composition, special effects:  The installation is performed flawlessly, at a high level. The composition of the frame is thought out to the smallest detail, and the special effects are used skillfully and unobtrusively. For example, one of the scenes shows a fight, which is mounted so that the viewer feels in the thick of things.  * Comparison with other films:  The series ""Peaky Blinders"" can be compared with such masterpieces of the criminal genre as ""The Sopranos Clan"" or ""The Crack"". However, the ""Peaky Blinders"" have their own unique atmosphere and style that make it special.  * Advantages and disadvantages of the film:  The advantages of the series include a fascinating plot, vivid characters, excellent acting, high-class directing and cinematography. There are practically no disadvantages.  * Originality, realism, logic:  The series is characterized by a high degree of originality and realism. The plot develops logically and consistently, without leaving the viewer at a loss. The script and characters create an atmosphere that feels real and alive. The logic of the events and actions of the characters keeps the viewer in suspense.  * Is watching a movie exciting in one go?  Absolutely! The series is exciting from the first minute. You will not be able to tear yourself away from the screen, you are eager to find out what will happen next.  * Unpredictability, suspense:  The series is characterized by a high degree of unpredictability and suspense. The viewer can never be sure what will happen next. Suspense and tension persist throughout the six seasons.  * Emotions, thoughts after (or on time) watching:  The series evokes a wide range of emotions, from excitement and delight to sadness and compassion. After watching the series, you will be left with mixed emotions: admiration, surprise, sadness and perhaps even some relief.  * Would you recommend, would you reconsider?  Of course, I would recommend this series to anyone who loves high-quality movies. And, of course, I am ready to review the ""Peaky Blinders"" once again.  * Impact on the worldview:  The series makes you think about morality, justice and the price of power. More on many things, such as family, loyalty, honor and betrayal. It undoubtedly changes the way you look at life and allows you to rethink many things. It impresses with its strangeness and depth.  * Personal impressions:  For me personally, ""Peaky Blinders"" has become one of the most vivid and memorable series of recent years. This series made me go through a whole range of emotions. It's not just a series, it's real art. I admire the way he skillfully combines drama and crime.  * Output:  ""Peaky Blinders"" is a true masterpiece of British cinema, which deserves the highest praise. This series captures from the first minutes and does not let go until the very end, leaving behind a lot of emotions and thoughts.  A masterpiece that will leave a mark on your memory. Watch it and you won't regret the time you spent.",10,positive
"Well the third season is little better than the second season and certainly not as good as the first season. The latest season is the Major Reacher let down. The female actresses are pretty awful and Khol's voice is high pitched and awful.  The first season was brilliant. If you have read quite a few of the books then the first season is definitely for you. You can't tell the difference between the book and the film it was that good. Also Alan Ritchson, who I remembered from Smallville and that was a brilliant drama series, looked spot on.  Personally I don't think the second season was any good even if you have not read the books!  This is absolutely important as Amazon seems to coming off the boil and onto back burner mode with some of its programmes of late. I have not written a review for a while but this needs saying  Is this cost cutting?  Where are you Lee Child - I thought you could write and have some influence?  I do not want to have to say to my other half: ""Well is it worth watching the latest episode?  Alan Ritchson was blown up (cycle pump springs to mind) physically into a too big version of Reacher. The don't even get the best out of attractive Serinda Swan, who acted loads better when she was a lot younger in Smallville. I think Krtistin Kreuk (Smallville again) put on a better show in the first season. Everything seemed real in Season 1 rather than tedious like the lion's share of the second season.  The acting is wishy-washy or deadpan and this goes for some of the actors perhaps because of uninvolved directors. There are loads of scenes (second season) which are a waste of time and I wanted to run on but wife wanted to stick it out like a trooper. To me it's like background intermission musak - if you know what I mean.  The only gravitas was the scenes actor Domenick Lombardozzi was involved in second season. You can't beat great actors. Remember him in ""The Wire. Get professional actors involved and do not drag them off the streets.  The usual boring flashbacks to a different era (2nd season) which you don't care about if the era the season is actually based on make you sigh.  Tell you what the second season of ""Reacher"" really show's how great the Tom Cruise films were, because even though he is not of the scale of Alan Ritchson the direction/acting etc of those films of a while ago were leagues ahead of this second and third seasons. It is ALL down to acting and the directors getting them to ACT!  Even ""Taken 3"" a cross between Reacher and ""Green Arrow"" is a great deal better than Season 2 of this. The 3rd season is little better.  Currently watching 3rd season which is better.",10,positive
Unbelievable how well they recreated this from the book. This is how Reacher should be depicted. Not Tom Cruise! Reacher is exactly how you would imagine him after reading the book. Highly recommend.,8,positive
"Peaky blinders is very well directed british TV show. But solid acting ( but not more) , very good music. It tell the real life story of the Peaky blinders in the 20'. The atmosphere is well created. But Unfortunately the story is simply not that interesting. So even if everything is done the right way, its difficult to really care about the characters or the story. Way too much boring political scenes not enough human interactions scenes ( they were the best) . At the end of the day im kinda mix about this one, not breaking my top 30 but give it a shot.  It is still better than boring tv shows like Chernobyl or Vikings by example.",10,positive
"Gotta love when a video game adaptation comes through not only for the fans, but also to newcomers. So far the show is everything a fan of the series since day one could ask for, and hopefully it will draw in an even larger crowd towards this masterpiece of a series. I've seen pretty much every video game adaptation whether it be movies, tv shows, or even books, and nothing comes close to how well this was done. Let this be a lesson to the writers of The Witcher series that straying too far from source material is a surefire way to produce a crap product. The casting in TLOU is amazing, Bella completely blew my expectations out of the water, Pedro is quite simply put, perfect, for the role of Joel, Gabriel Luna as Tommy is eerily similar to his character in the game......like his voice sounds almost exactly like Tommy!!! The set designs are incredible. Can't wait for more of this masterpiece!!!",9,positive
"I love how they have added so much to the small details of Star Wars such as the different alien creatures and the details, cgi doesn't look over the top looks realistic and amazing, looks 1000% better than the new movies they recently done which where diabolical, This hands down beats the recent trilogy of movies the look the story and the added details which makes a Star Wars film just makes me wonder with the directors the story writers and bigger budget what they have could have done with the recent trilogy of films, hope this becomes and series after series thing love it",10,positive
"The Witcher  I loved it!  In many way this series was a bit of a mess, the box set skipped around, half the time we had no clue what this or that meant, and the whole thing lacked cohesiveness, whether this was entirely intentional I would think not. However by the end of the series we were less confused and there were some elements that created better connection. In summation this was not easy viewing.  Whoever did the casting was inspired, we had in the main seasoned pros, this well upped the whole series. Henry Cavill was perfect for the role and a master of the aside, the deadpan humour and a good deal of comic timing.  There were so many good things here we were spoilt, it does need to raise itself before it becomes mired in teenage angst or to many special effects, it is the strength of story and dramatic impetus that will make this show stand out.  If someone is truly evil make them so no half measures.  I just can't wait for series 2, I want it now......!  Series 2 in reality,  What the hell happened here, we had an original and authentic show about a ruthless mutant mercenary who worked for coin and nothing more, he picked up a bard and the dialogue interplay between these two provided the charm and humour. This show has sunk down to the blandness of so many other shows losing it authenticity and it's original audience.  What with the woke inserts, the seriousness, the lack of action, it really was a step down from series 1 which is a great disappointment.  The dialogue was stilted and cumbersome and the plot meandered with little narrative impetus. Do they not realise we are all sick of origin stories and stream of banal and posturing words that give the impression of profundity. There was just nothing new here. Our glorious Witcher has turned into a childminder it was a colossal bore.  This has turned into a sword and sandal pot-boiler and lost its USP. For me it's a 3 outta 10.",10,positive
"I haven't found yet a crime movie better than peaky blinders.  A deep chemistry from all Star and strong character from Cillian Murphy will never be changed.  This movie make us understood about fast decision making, learn the enemy weakness and open our eyes about how important the family chemistry is.  From the first session to the last session the main character of Thomas Shelby makes this movie the most important lesson to be watched for all young and middle old generation who wants to be successful in politics, business and love. Knowledge and experience combined by Thomas Shelby expression.",10,positive
I really dont know how this show deserves an 8+ Stars rating. Crime story is solid - ok. But the overall acting is cringy and pretty artificial.  I would give it something around 7 but there are too many highratings.,10,positive
Great show with Costner understated as usual. A multitude of solid storylines that are credible but you do yearn for some good luck for the Duttons. Without spoilers you do wonder at the quantity of corrupt characters and the speed of healing of the human body. One flaw is how come the geek has all the pretty girls falling over him? The 'baddie' is well cast and has a face you instantly want to punch but maintains his role to keep the storylines going. A little bit of feelgood scenarios would not go amiss with all the bad luck but maybe a sign of the times that scriptwriters think we need constant strife to keep us watching.,9,positive

"I didn't have a subscription to HULU until the word that The Handmaid's Tale was a favorite for award season. I gave in and watched this amazing series. The acting, directing, cinematography just brilliant while kind if depressing at the same time. Dark and stays with you. Huge fan of Elizabeth Moss who is so awesome and emotionally believable, Alexis Bledel who I now have found a new respect for her acting skills, Ann Dowd who is just so amazing, Samira Wiley who is superb, and Madeline Brewer, just brilliant. I hope Yvonne Strahovski gets credit for her role as Mrs. Waterford (remember Hannah from Dexter??) because she was one cold wife but yet, I found myself feeling sorry for her. I can't get enough of this drama and hope that season 2 gets here quickly.",6,neutral
"School of Rock and Enlightened creator Mike White has graced us with his next project after a long creative break. The difference between these productions and the HBO six-parter The White Lotus could hardly be greater. Here we meet a group of pampered nouveau riche who treat themselves to a holiday at the Hawaiian luxury resort The White Lotus. Everyday we get to know unsympathetic people better and learn that even they have human and sensitive sides.  The series runs with an ensemble cast worth mentioning, with every actor delivering their A-game. In the end, however, three actors in particular take the cake. Firstly, Murray Burnett as the hotel manager Armond, whose initially charismatic and endeavouring manner to make the difficult guests have an ideal stay sways all sympathy to his side. From episode to episode, however, we learn new, darker sides about the character that make Armond the most multifaceted, fascinating and at the same time tragic figure. Despite his obvious flaws and shortcomings, you can't help but sympathise with him. Burnett plays Armond with all his facets and above all charisma, making him the quintessential scene stealer. Alexandra Daddario and Jennifer Coolidge must also be singled out in the string of great performances. Daddario's Rachel is newly married and just wants to enjoy her honeymoon. However, during this time she realises the true colours of her spoiled millionaire husband Shane (Jake Lacy) and begins to question her decisions. With Shane being the most despicable character ever, you feel for Rachel and can't help but root for her. This is thanks in part to Daddario's career-best performance and likability. Coolidge is the exact opposite, a hypochondriac crybaby who could hardly be more sensitive and needy. What she is, however, is entertaining. If Burnett is the scene stealer, Coolidge dominates the screen with her inimitable presence and otherness in each of her scenes. The rest of the cast, from arguably the most unlikable family ever around husband and wife Nicole (Connie Britton) and Mark (Steve Zahn), their children Olivia (Sydney Sweeney) and Quinn (Fred Hechinger), to Olivia's college friend Paula (Brittany O'Grady) and spa director Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) have their own problems and obsessions that we come to love in a perverted way as well. Zahn and Hechinger's characters in particular grow on you over time for some inexplicable reason.  Although every single character in The White Lotus has no guarantee of accessibility or likeability, White manages to give them almost all a crown of their own in just six episodes. Beautifully filmed, it evokes a holiday feeling from the first second that I found hard to dismiss. Only the murder mystery that is hinted at in the first episode, forgotten in between and finally resolved in the finale feels a little rushed and out of place. Likewise, it's the final decisions of some characters that I couldn't really live with and that actually ruined these characters for me. But none of this changes the fact that The White Lotus, despite its cringey dialogue and actual nastiness, is probably the most bizarre and in a curious way entertaining series of the year.",10,positive
"If someone is having fun they will be punished because all of these characters derive enjoyment from drugs, alcohol, scandalous relations, manipulating others, then they're going to be punished. It's the same thing as Euphoria and It's a Sin. Though it is a very funny show and there is heaps of character development, I felt very depressed watching it at times. If I had to breakdown the scores I would say:  Character: 8/10 In way, every character is an archetype waiting to be deconstructed. Their problems are all apparent from the first episode. Vanity, unhappy marriage, privilege, depression. Most of their problems stem from unhappiness and insecurities. I both loved and hated them.  Acting: 9/10 (Jennifer Coolige is a living legend, Alexandra Daddario shined). I loved the actors, they really sold every character.  Directing: 8/10 Amazing tension at the most seemingly normal conversations. The camera was still during the conversation scenes, which was more complicated than simply shot reverse shot. I liked how the shot would get shakey whenever something was very clearly wrong, to add dismay.  Story: 6/10 Every episode is about 24 hours of the guests' week long stat at The White Lotus. The pacing is great here. Nothing felt dragged out or too short. I wish they gave us more information on Hawaiin history. There are a few characters who are Hawaii locals and one somewhat discusses colonialism. However, he references history and uses words that flew over my head. I wondered if it was satire, but I think it was an oversight. This made the Hawaiian backdrop stereotypical, as if the writers criticizing white privilege forgot to consult locals and just read Hawaii's wikipedia page. The culmination of each character's arc was deserved. It left off on an open ending. I look forward to the continuation.  This is a comedy drama miniseries with a touch of mystery. In the first episode it is hinted one of the characters died. Inevitably it is revealed and it had me guessing until the end. The comedy was intentionally cringeworthy and it worked. The critiques of white privilege, colonialism, and especially pretentious zoomers pretending to be holier than thou while benefitting from middle class America. That hit me pretty hard. I think if you come away from this unchallenged, you have missed the point. It doesn't give you a solution to privilege, it just recognizes it's there and reminds you to respect the things you have because someone was exploited so you could have it.  Sometimes it had me yelling at the screen, laughing out loud, or burying my hands in my palms.  Overall: 7.8/10.",7,neutral
Brilliantly conceived directed and acted. Fabulous cinematography. For me Steve Zahn and Brittany O'Grady shone out strongly. Jake Lacy and Lucas Gage deliver some artful transitions. I love being able to forget that acting is happening. The whole show is perfectly cast and extremely well written. Really exciting music choices and compositions.  Nice to see characters with such depth.,9,positive
"A bit hesitant these days to start new series but I really liked this one. Camera work, filming, acting and character development is really well done. End of S2, it starts to get a bit slow but overall I understand the progression. Unless you plan on watching this with young kids around, I wouldn't worry about the other reviews. It amazes me how people can review a show as ""disgusting"" because they decided to watch it with or around their kids and discovered it has adult themes. Save yourself the trouble and check out the ""Parental Guide"" at the bottom of this page. That's why IMDB created it.",9,positive
"My wife and I love the series. Except for all the cursing. We understand it in real life, but why does it have to be in the series?There are lots of ""movie mistakes"" if you will, that experienced people will pick up on. If Taylor Sheridan is just trying to make the show more believable, work on making it all believable, not just the cursing and nakedness. Taylor has reincarnated evil with the character of Beth. I hope I never meet a version of her in real life! She is a true destroyer, with very few good feelings. She could be the anti-Christ.",9,positive
"In my opinion, the characters remained dislikable or to shallow to carry the story. Actually I waited the whole serie that it would get better or turn around, as the plot and the reviews were quite promising.  The actors did a good job, but so many interactions and dialoges were just to long, over the top, or cringe. Good potential, but character building and development were done unsatisfactory. Not sure if it intended to be a satire? But they didn't achieved that.  But I still watched it to the end to see how it ends, so not totally bad. Watch it if you like nice Hawaii pictures and music, though.",8,positive
"Alan Ritchson plays this analytical, straight-talking, kick-butt ""giant"" of a character perfectly! :-) I can watch him all day with his unconventional way of interacting with people! I also loved the hardcore action/fight scenes that you don't often see in a TV series! :-) But, I could have done without the overly convoluted plot that creates unnecessary confusion and has more than a few holes :-( I am hoping the second season will do better on this front :-)",7,neutral
"Took me a few episodes to get into but boy now I'm enjoying it to the fullest. I'm a great fan of the show Succession and I think Yellowstone has some similar elements and I love that.  I like the character development, scenes about their background, the setting in this beautiful landscape and the story itself (which will get a bit repetitive but I'm fine with that). Most of the characters are extremely relatable and this is the reason why I'm very much dragged into the show on an emotional basis.  I would definitely recommend to show to anyone, specially to people that like character driven shows like Succession, The Bear etc.",10,positive
Absolutely incredible start and i cant say when i have seen such a good pilot of a series... The characters are extremely good choosen... This is Excactly what i wanted it to look like.  Hbo is bringing another amazing show to us that will blow everyones minds... the actors are giving goosebumps already... Im played the games and of course loved them as anyone else did... but bringing it to life and make sure that its that good is something else.  Also its not about doing justice to those who played the games... i need everyone to love this as it is... I cant wait for what its coming next.  Amazing job HBO did ones again!!!,3,negative
"I really enjoyed S1, the plot was dramatic and had many unknown spots. While in S2 everything looked predictable or easy to figure out, despite the small intrigue if Swan was playing with the bad guys or not.  Something was missing in S2, and even Reacher looked kinda different.... Like, exhausted of playing the role. He looked like he spent too much time at the solarium, tanned and grumpy.  To me in S2 it looked like the actor was playing the role because he had to, not because he wanted to... I don't know if there was some tension between actor and filming crew, but it looked like pretty different approach than in S1. Maybe that's because the cameraman and directors were different? I'm not sure..  I haven't read the books of Lee Child and that makes the series more watchable tho.  Looking forward to S3 and hopefully Reacher will find it's charisma back.  7/10 is a fair rating, imo.",10,positive
"Season one is great - strong 9 Season two episode one - 10 The rest of season two is - good 7 Season three is - barely 6  Season one had some confusing timelines, but in general it worked really well. Each episode had a standalone story combined with the main story. And chemistry worked well between characters.  Season two episode one was a culmination of this approach. Most probably the best episode of a Witcher.  The rest of season two is an average adventure story, still good, but cracks and lazy writing starts to appear.  Season three is just a downfall from here. Hard to understand why writers decided to ruin a perfectly good series. No idea ?????",6,neutral
"I am such a big GOT fan that i expected to hate it. For me the bar is set so high with GOT. But to my great surprise, I really really love The Witcher. The production is just beyond superb, the way the story is told and started to slowly unfold is riveting and the casting for the top 3 characters is great. Henry Cavill really did justice to the character and I so love him as Geralt of Rivia. His preparation for the role is so insane and his sword fighting moves are the best. Anya Chalotra as Yennefer of Vengerberg is also amazing and gave so much depth to the character. She is my favorite character though and i'm so rooting for her. I hate that season 2 will be aired on 2021. The wait is just terrible for me.",10,positive
"The book has been one of my favorites for years, and the show has not let me down since I started watching it years ago. Of course the book doesn't encompass the entire series, but I feel they do a fantastic job. A lot of people on here saying it's not true to the book. Some things are different in the first season but not plot changing details. The show works with Atwood herself as a consulting producer, especially in the first season, and she approves of the series as a whole. It's a tough watch sometimes, and it's not always happy. But then again life is not always happy, especially given the country and torment they are subjected to. Everything from set design, to story telling, to character development (and sometimes regression) is fantastic. I recommend this show to everyone.",8,positive
"I was hoping for some dumb fun like the Tom Cruise series of Reacher films. With this series, unfortunately, you only get dumb.  The Reacher character is unbelievable and inconsistent. His mom calls him only by his last name (""Reacher"") even though he has an older brother. It's weird. I don't buy it. He is supposed to be both a savvy investigator and an extremely strong and capable fighter. Yet at crucial moments he struggles in fights with little guys, and spends the whole time just one step behind the viewer in solving the case, let alone one step behind the bad guys. Not that it ends up mattering, because just as he's finally piecing together the all-too-obvious clues, the bad guys reveal themselves anyway.  The callbacks are obnoxious. The plot holes exhausting. The characters paper thin.  Not worth watching.",7,neutral
"We watched the first season of this show with curiosity. We thought it was well done and smartly written, with irritating characters whose stupid stories were surprisingly captivating.  Then we watched the second season and... The first episode was painful, the characters were unrealistically annoying, the music was Italian for tourists, the whole thing was full of clichés. But we gave the season a chance, because we kept reading such good reviews. Well, these are a mystery to us: The following episodes did improve a bit, which was not hard, but still failed to reach a decent level. Characters either don't evolve (the three men with Italian origins) or they evolve too quickly and randomly (the shy hooker). Plots are either non existent (the two couples of friends, sooo boring) or they are ridiculously outlandish (the rich woman who was also in season 1, so far fecthed).  A pity, really. The idea is good and the cinematography is excellent. But the realization is too weak.",9,positive
I watch every episode of the series so far. Henry Cavill's portrayal Geralt is the only reason to watch the show. The rest of the cast's performance is forgettable. The script writers are lazy. I hear Netflix is replacing him as Geralt and changing the tone of the show. Netflix seem to not understand or not care what matters to the audience. Netflix continues to self destruct. Destroying such a popular show by removing the one sure draw of it is foolish and makes me want to change my subscription to another service. It is like removing Tom Cruise from Top Gun. Replacing Keanu Reeves as John Wick.,10,positive
"The title of the review is a rhetorical question really. I know what happened; what I mean is, why was the show abandoned and passed off to second rate writers? The first season was spectacular. It ticked every box to be a good ol fashioned action flick. The second season seems to be suffering from a case of, ""The Panderverse.""  ""rEaChEr'S bAcK"" alright. Team Reacher that is, because it would seem the titular character has taken a backseat to a rag-tag group of misfits. In his own show, he is a supporting character. How rich. The terrible one-liners and conveniences are a symptom of bad writing, plot armor and unusual decisions made completely out of character are made for the sake of moving the story forward. It's unbearable to endure.  Bring back the season one writers or just cancel the show. I'm giving it 5 stars because the first season was perfect and the the second season is the exact opposite.",7,neutral
"Finally finished S5 today after +- 18 months of watching. First off the bat I've gotta say that what always stood out for me in 5 seasons of the show, was the phenomenal cinematography. So many shows have top cinematics, but The Handmaid's Tale delivered EVERY episode with the photography. Genius  The pacing of the show was very slow at times and the pacing of scenes were also very tedious. Had to watch episodes at 1.25 speed just to avoid the laborious nature.  Other than that it was a top show regardless. Always played on my emotions. It didn't always pull me in after every episode and the BIG moments were almost always reserved for the beginning & end of each season. I was still invested with the show and thought about it often. Never thought of ever ditching it. Always wanted to finish it as it was quality.  Something that kinda got monotonous was Elizebeth Moss's acting. She's a phenomenal actress don't get me wrong, but sometimes they overdid it with the EXTREME CLOSE UP shots and the repetitive ""face twitching"". It almost felt like they knew she was good at acting in that particular style and milked it for all it's worth.  Season 5 was good but kinda went nowhere slowly. They got me with the final scene with Sarena Joy & June reuniting. I always had hope for Sarena and thought that there was always a semblance of good in her.  I don't wanna have any expectations for S6 and would rather just let it play out.  I really like the cast and the style of story telling. However I'm genuinely relieved that S6 is the final season. They've dragged on for maybe 2 seasons too many but I'm not complaining. Hopefully they end well and give us a satisfying/realistic ending.",9,positive
"The morphing of Tim Burton's expressionistic burlesque with the macabre deadpan satire of the Addam's family is such a natural and obvious fit that it seems like a match made in Heaven, if not a more purgatorial locale. Fans of both will not be disappointed by this refreshing reboot!  Moonlit nights, rebellious youths, macabre humour, and outlandish costumes are spiced up with snappy dialogue, and enough intertextually ironic interplay and Easter eggs to keep even the most earnest of cinephiles eagerly satisfied.  Danny Elfman's score punctuates the quixotic fantasy while pop musical motifs are borrowed from far and wide to underscore both the drama and droll humour.  This review is based only on the first episode, but this viewer has already bought into the series!",8,positive
"Where do I even begin? It's so freaking awesome. The suspense that built after finishing episode made me so addicted that I couldn't stop watching it. It's a show that I would always watch it again. Truly awsome, The actors were right on spot and never made me feel bored. It's my new favorite show. Plus it's a show that was hard to predict what was going to happen next which is something that I truly like and makes the viewer stay hooked. Wasn't expecting all the twist and turns. Hope they make second season which I would definitely watch it based on this first season. The ending left me speechless and left more questions for me.",9,positive
"That subject line is not hyperbole. The character development, screenplay, directing & acting are top notch. THIS is the one to watch if you've been wavering about The Mandelorian, Boba Fett or Oni Wan Kenobi series.  Andor is a top tier drama / suspense story that just happens to be set in the Star Wars universe. The main characters are complex and varied with some of today's best acting talent appearing throughout.  The story is well-paced, keeping the viewer engaged. The build-ups are suspenseful and the special effects are on point with modern standards.  The look & feel of the created universe is authentic. Production has done a superb job immersing us in varied destinations across diverse landscapes.  Watch it and tell me I'm wrong. You can't.  Enjoy!",10,positive

"I honestly wasn't sure what to expect from this show. As a fan of the Addams Family, with Wednesday being one of my favorite characters, I decided to give it a try. The show delivered on what I was hoping for with regards to Wednesday herself, featuring a dark storyline and dramatic moments due to her character's antics. The cast was great, and there weren't many disappointments there. However, I did have some issues with certain aspects of the storyline, as it felt lacking in character development and didn't capture the essence of the original Addams Family characters. While there were some pleasant surprises, I'm still unsure how I feel about the show overall. If you're a die-hard fan of the Addams Family, it might be worth checking out, but be ready to overlook some of the shortcomings.",10,positive

"It just had to be said really. Even Tom can't ""Act tall"". Reacher's physical presence was a key element in the original writing, and forms part of his character.

"New TV series streaming from Amazon, my wife and I watched two episodes on each of four successive nights. Sort of like movie nights. This is not high art, the writing has lots of humor, in real life Reacher couldn't get away with everything depicted. BUT ... it is a very entertaining series. Especially for those of us who enjoy seeing a smart, mild-mannered, well-spoken, well-trained, big tough guy put the bad guys in their places. Some simple thugs, some unruly prison inmates, some dirty cops. Ritchson is a real good pick for the role. (In an interview he said he gained 30 pounds for the role.)  My only disappointment, after watching the opening scenes at least a dozen times now, is that bite of peach pie never reaches Reacher's mouth when the local cops enter the cafe. However, they eventually rectified that!  Reacher is an ex-military man, he takes a bus to the small Georgia town, walks to town to look up an old blues singer's home, immediately gets arrested for murder, but eventually works with local law enforcement to help solve the mysteries, and there are several.  Most episodes are roughly 45 to 50 minutes long, set in a fictional Georgia town not far from Atlanta but filmed in Canada. Cast and characters are interesting. The story is not too deep but surprisingly interesting, just good entertainment. Streaming on Amazon.  Season 2: As we would expect with a different book as the source, with a different set of supporting characters, season 2 has a much different look and feel to it. As it starts we see a helicopter dropping a man, maybe already dead, into a snowy area of the mountains, north of Manhattan. Then it abruptly switches to Arkansas where Reacher is at a thrift shop and at the ATM notices a woman bruised and in tears, he promptly thwarts a carjacking.  After the first three episodes my wife and I are enjoying it but the content has more violence, shootings and killings. I suppose to appease some cross-section of viewers but I don't find it as interesting or as entertaining. While season one is ""superb"" season two, so far, is just ""decent entertainment.""  Season 3: As we expected, was totally different. It starts with Reacher in a used vinyl store in Maine when he notices something strange outside, it turns out to be an attempted kidnapping which he foils. The target was the son of a wealthy man played by Anthony Michael Hall, former teen star. Then there is the Belgian giant playing a guard named Pauli. Overall an interesting set of episodes, to us more enjoyable than season 2.  APR 2023 update: Over about 2 days I rewatched all of season 1, it was fresh enough after three years that I enjoyed it as much, knowing what the overall storyline was had me look at many scenes from a different angle. Season 1 is super, the others just OK.",6,neutral
"Marvel and Disney have been in quiet a tailspin in the post Disney era. After Kenobi and recent Marvel offerings I was just to give about to call it a day and retire from even entertainment the idea of watching new entries.  For Andor, the first 2 episodes were decent enough to keep me coming back for another episode. The 3rd episode is where I started to appreciate what this series was setting up and the tone it was going to carry through the season. By mid season I felt this was definitely one the must watches of the year.  I am looking forward to season 2 and do yourself a favor and be sure to stay through the credits of the finale episode!",7,neutral
I love this show. I can't miss or stop watching. Love the cowboys. Best thing on TV. Once you start watching you can't quit! Wonderful ?? love Kevin Costner and the whole family. Everyone is tough as nails. No wimps. Beautiful scenery and animals. The actors act like they're really related ?? everyone can relate to that. Rip is so handsome and he doesn't hesitate to take care of a problem. No matter what Kevin Costner plays in he's one of the greatest actor I know. Beth what can I say that girl can kick some ass! Luke another handsome man and he's tough too. Jamie is kinda a wimp! Start watching you'll love it and be hooked!,9,positive
"Tim Burton is back with a very fun, dark and dynamic show - a reminder of his talent.  Finally, he chose a representative and diverse cast, with outstanding performances by all the actors involved. They all do a fantastic job with their roles, with Jenna Ortega stealing the show. It's like the role was written for her, she is humorous, dark and beautiful (the 'dance scene' in episode 4 is just magic). The chemistry between the actors was also spot on. I enjoyed that throughout the story the characters bring up themes around loneliness, death, love, emotions, family - existential aspects we all hold close to us.  Great direction and cinematography, nothing less than expected from Tim Burton. The music accompanying the show is syncing amazingly with the scenes. He takes you to another of his magical worlds with the Addams family in the centre of it.",3,negative
"If you're an avid fan of the Witcher universe, don't bring the expectation that the show will stick to the source material 100% because a lot is curated so it is presentable in the TV format. With that being said, Henry Cavill manages to capture the essence of Geralt's character extremely well and is definitely the highlight of the show. The acting overall is far from terrible as some reviews seem to suggest and other than the obvious gaffes of casting such as Fringilla Vigo being played by a black actress and some other black characters showing up in a universe that's supposed to be set in medieval northern Europe there isn't much to nitpick at.",10,positive

I like the characters and the cast.  But after 8 episodes I give up.  Nothing really happens. It is slow, which can make a point in itself, but in this case it is over the line and simply makes it waste of time to watch. I don't even really care about what happens next because it has lost me on the no action at all. One movie could have been ok, but 5 seasons of many and long episodes is simply too much time to spend on watching no development in the history. I really wanted to like it.",7,neutral
"Review is for Season 1. I'm not sure if I will attempt season 2 since this did little to enthrall me. Nothing about is was particularly bad, but nothing was outstanding, either. The acting and production were very good, and the characters were realistic, but no storyline or character stood out as especially interesting. The theme seemed to boil down to rich people are carelessly cruel and miserable, and customer service sucks. These are not earth-shattering revelations. It all felt very middling. It wasn't funny enough to be a true comedy, nor serious enough to be a drama. It wasn't thrilling enough to really be a mystery and didn't leave me with any unique perspectives on life that haven't been done many times before. Fine enough to pass the time, but easy enough to skip.",6,neutral
"After hearing great reviews from some of my colleagues I felt like I needed to watch this 'excellent' show. Boy, I really don't get it. This series is some of the slowest and most booooooring things I've ever seen. I'm at the end of S1 right now in the hope something exciting -no scratch that- in the hope that SOMETHING would happen and this just isn't the case. If you're a fan to watch the same boring things all over again, you will love this. Because that's all it is. Go to the store, get the story t in an unrealistic way and when something suspenseful is about to happen, we realize they're about to....... play scrabble! My God. I've made it through the first season but I regret it, it's time wasted I will never get back. Next please!",7,neutral
"Was thinking it's either a 7 or 8 but other than how much I enjoyed this there's so much to appreciate, this is so well put together, from the effects like thing and other monsters to the really good sets and scenes. Lots of pretty good writing that got a smirk out of me and the running time of each episode makes you feel like it's a decent chunk of time but thankful for it. The villain of the story wasn't immediately figured out which is always a plus and the side characters are all decent. If the second series is rubbish, which I doubt it's not then I'm still happy to give this such a high score as the first season is well contained as a full story. I feel like it might be hard for them to continue with such energy but with Tim Burton involved I have good hopes.",1,negative
"I'd give the first 2 seasons a 9.5/10, amazing to watch. Then season 3 happened and i just didnt care at all what was happening, basically after Campbell's death the writing went downhill. I would give s3 a 5/10, then season 4 comes with a comeback, i actually liked the italian mob fiasco, it was pretty great 7.5/10.  Then season 5 is the biggest snoozefest so far, again 4.5/10, by this point i want less slow motions and cool scenes of all the Shelbies but better writing, something close to what made the first 2 seasons so great. I felt s4 tried to do that but s5 needs to be the last one if they're continue the same stuff. Tom Hardy was amazing, need more of him.",10,positive
"And never work again. It's clear the show runner and writers had their own agenda. They attempted to take a novel and video game, they could never come close to achieving and add what they think is current and politically correct.

The worst part of all this is how long we will have to wait for it to be picked up and redone by a different company. They really thought we would like this trash.

"Several reviews have critiqued the series by commenting on how Moss looks ""too old"" to be a handmaid - she doesn't look ""fecund"" enough according to a couple of reviews, and some people object to her level of attractiveness (or not).  First of all, the whole point of how Gilead was to have started was that the birth rates were falling so precipitously and healthy births even more so.  So all women of childbearing years were tested and those few who had ""viable"" healthy ovaries were taken to be handmaids. It wouldn't matter what their age was (within childbearing years of course), or what they looked like.  Secondly, Elisabeth Moss was brave enough to appear without any makeup. In other words, she didn't have someone putting all kinds of concealers etc to make her look dewy and ""natural."" She, and the other actresses, actually didn't wear any.  It was obviously jarring to some viewers, seeing a woman on television who isn't wearing a full face of makeup. How dare she, right?  Ms. Moss is, to me, an average-looking Everywoman.  I think the second season was actually better than the first - I did think the first season could be a little ponderous at times; I agree with some of those criticisms.",6,neutral
"There are some reviews about how bad the writing is. Now me, I haven't played any of the games. So besides being completely lost from the start, writing is so bad that in a 30 seconds timeframe it seems I have missed 3 entire episodes, BUT - there were no such episodes. Every single event - and plot twist - is simply unpremised, unexplained and unjustified. New characters pop up and the storyline changes out of nowhere, major events happen within a cutscene. Absurdly terrible, almost unwatchable, this is the kind of show that you wanna keep watching just to see how worse it can possibly get. The difficulty of making every episode worse than the previous, is the same of making every episode better than the previous, if that's the case I'll come back here and give it 2 stars instead of 1.",6,neutral

"It's been a while to find it after the vanity project from Tom Cruise, a the 6ft 5"" man mountain with a 50"" chest played by a 5ft 7"" guy never made any sense, this however is a much better depiction, Alan Richson manages to tread the fine line between violent psycho and moral crusader, he embodies the Reacher role.  The story is fast paced with some really decent acting and great action scenes, it's rare that you watch a series and you try to out off watching the last ep because you want to savour it.  Willa Fitzgerald does a great job of playing the tough cop in a male dominated world with a softer side and Malcolm Goodwin is always good in everything he's done that I have seen, bring on S2.",7,neutral
So i have watched series 1 and 2 with a range of emotions. The beautiful and convincing acting from all brings an edge to this tale which could of so easily been lost with special effects and over acting. The fact the pace is slower than many things out there is One of the reasons it gripped me. With each scene there was time to catch your breath and absorb the craziness which was unfolding.  The subtle looks and stolen smiles mixed between a brutal regime of control and knowing your place work effortlessly together.  The relationship you form watching the superb acting takes your breath away and brings tears to your eyes.  Humans are simply vile and equally wonderful  This series shows this to a tee.

"You can do any kind of genre under an ultra-popular and proven IP like Star Wars.

This is a sweeping political thriller, obviously left-wing coded (""great left-wing art"" in NYT's resident conservative Ross Douthat's words), tackling both some eternal questions about strategy and tactics of insurgency movements to some current political conflicts: Illegal migration, the carceral state, colonialism, capitalism, energy politics, extraction of minerals etc.  It's an ensemble piece, there are no star-making turns and it's just a lot of servicable performances. Over two years in between seasons I honestly remembered none of the actors when the second season started, nor remembered their plotlines, the acting is not where this is at. The last three episodes of the second season got weaker because they had to tie it all in with the preceeding movie and do the fan-service for all the obsessive fandom, but it's generally not constrained by being Star Wars. It looks great too.  Two thumbs up for Tony Gilroy.",4,negative
"I have read most of Lee Child's Jack Reacher series. Book's Reacher is tough, tall, fast and master of street fighting. A Sherlock Holmes when it comes to solving mysteries. Prime's Reacher is all that but unfortunately the actor fails to humanized, for lack of a better word, his character. Watching the first episode, my girlfriend thought Reacher is animation, produced by a computer program. He is like a robot, something like the Terminator. (even Terminator could spark some emotion).  Compared that to The Witcher, he starts the first episode, talking to a wounded animal.  Lee Child's stories fail to attach the events of the books to real world locations, the way Michael Connelly is able to do with Harry Bosch.  Prime's Reacher would have benefited from a slower pace, more character development first, before jumping to fight scenes. Instead, Reacher doesnt even talk for a long time to start the first episode.  I think I will still watch the series, but I wish they had done more than some smart comments ( is there a man nailed to the wall?) in-between the fight scenes.",8,positive
"Peaky Blinders is a solid show that's definitely worth checking out! The cinematography is straight-up stunning-it legit feels like you're dropped into the gritty 1920s and 1930s. The visuals alone make every scene pop.  Cillian Murphy absolutely kills it as Thomas Shelby, turning him into an iconic character you can't forget. Tom Hardy nailed it and deserves an award for his performance. The rest of the cast is no slouch either-everyone brings their A-game and makes the world feel real.  With 36 episodes across six seasons, some moments drag a bit, and the pacing could've been tighter. A few storylines start feeling repetitive, but let me tell you, the sixth episode of each season are awesome. They're always a highlight, though they don't single-handedly save the weaker seasons.  Here's my quick take on each season: **Season 1**: Good start, sets the vibe nicely. (7/10) **Season 2**: The Best Season (9/10) **Season 3**: Kinda meh, not bad but not amazing. (6/10) **Season 4**: Bounces back strong. (8/10) **Season 5**: Another so-so one for me. (6/10) **Season 6**: Emotional finale that hits hard. (8/10)  Overall, I'd give it a 7/10. It's a good show with some killer moments, but it didn't blow me away every single time. Still, if you're into crime dramas with style, you'll probably dig it!",10,positive
"The movie is beyond my expectation. The Reacher character suits Ritchson very well. The plot and the energy of the movie are amazing. It's a movie full of action and plots.those. Those who read the novel Killing Floor will notice that the plot is exactly the same. In its purest sense, we can say that the Reacher series is a production with Sherlock Holmes analogies. Reacher, contrary to appearances, is not someone who solves his problems only with violence. He also tries to decipher people's petty actions and tendencies, their personalities, and their backgrounds in an insightful way using the knowledge he has gained while traveling the world, and he reads people at once.",9,positive
"I don't get hooked on series very often but this on got me even though I find June absolutely infuriating. Season 4 just starts feeling repetitive and on the verge of annoying, for some reason they just keep putting out the same exact plot every season with slight differences in scenery. Still love recommend the first 3 seasons if you love dark and twisted shows!",10,positive
"Good show. THE LAST OF US was indeed a great series. After hearing many raves and good things from people that I know, I finally decided to give it a chance. Like the game, it is definitely worth your time. Well made, compelling and great characters with real chemistry made this series a fun watch, a slower build to some pretty intense scenes. While it did have periods of time that it moved more slowly, it certainly never felt boring. Pedro Pascal as Joe Miller and Bella Ramsey as Ellie Williams made this a great show, and the chemistry they develop feels natural and heart warming, Very Good show.",9,positive

"In a world where video game adaptations have often struggled to find their footing on the small screen, The Last of Us stands out as a shining example of how to do it right. The series, based on the beloved video game, has managed to retain the most addictive elements of its source material while weaving a deeper and emotionally charged narrative that stands on its own.  One of the most impressive aspects of The Last of Us is its ability to strike a balance between homage and originality. While some scenes lifted directly from the game may have led to pacing issues for some viewers, the show's departure from the game's narrative has been a breath of fresh air, enriching the story and drawing in both fans and newcomers alike.  The production design deserves applause, as it masterfully recreates the game's environments, making viewers feel like they've stepped right into the post-apocalyptic world. The use of lighting and cinematography adds an extra layer of depth, drawing out the humanity of the characters and creatures in a way that sets it apart from other adaptations.  Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey's performances as Joel and Ellie are nothing short of exceptional. Their chemistry on screen is magnetic, making them irresistibly watchable as they navigate the challenges and dangers of their journey. Pascal's portrayal of Joel has been described as a true embodiment of the character, while Ramsey's portrayal of Ellie has been hailed as a breakout performance, striking a perfect balance between comedy and emotion.  The guest performances in The Last of Us are a true highlight, with a talented cast delivering remarkable portrayals that add richness to the narrative. Each character feels authentic and well-crafted, contributing to the show's overall success.  While the show offers thrilling action sequences, it is during its quieter moments that The Last of Us truly shines. These moments allow the characters to breathe, bringing out the complexities of their personalities and forging powerful emotional connections with the audience.  The Last of Us isn't just a show; it's an experience. With its captivating storytelling, outstanding performances, and stunning production design, it stands as a compelling example of how to adapt a video game into a binge-worthy TV series. Whether you're a fan of the game or a newcomer to this world, The Last of Us is an absolute must-watch.",9,positive
I love that I'm the odd one out! The acting is delightfully hilarious despite the fact of that a lot goes wrong throughout. I absolutely love it's written and directed by Mike White that also wrote School of Rock awhile back which to me is a spectacular movie so that's probably why I enjoy so much! Even the ones that don't enjoy the series it's worth watching for Alexandra Daddario and some of the other cast. Even though the first couple episodes didn't do that well I'm sure the next ones will be better!,10,positive
"I'm enjoying white lotus, 5 episodes in so far but I fell already it just can't compete with the amazing Benidorm serious. Both have similar plots based on dysfunctional family's in holiday with shock moments in the storyline. But working class British humour beats the spoilt rich Americans all day long.  White lotus has a very good cast and is very enjoyable to watch, and I'm looking forward to seeing how these characters evolve over the coming episodes and series.  Rumours are rife that there is going to be another series of Benidorm in the making, so white lotus will more than do until then.",8,positive
"Excellent character building, pacing and plot structure with no rushing towards story beats via forced or badly fabricated story that doesn't serve the overall arcs and plot. Characters are not 'paint by numbers' good v evil archetypes. They are well rounded, morally ambiguous characters just getting caught up in the mechanisms moving and collapsing in the world around them.  Andor tells the story in a more refined way than many other Disney shows by 'chunking' smaller arcs building towards the finale.  The dialogue is brilliant. Exposition goes unnoticed as the characters are mature and grounded and they speak to each other in an appropriate way.  The Empire is returned to its Empire Strikes Back and Rogue One status where it presented true menace: Where it was both oppressive and competent in its subjugation of the galaxy.  The rebellion is so well set-up here. Andor shows the dangerous and messy set up of the rebellion in its earliest stages. On the flip-side It creates a story that shows us the inside of the Empire- the cogs that internally spin to make the machine brutal and efficient.  Andor treats its audience like 'grown-ups' and just like Rogue One it shows viewers that Star Wars can be clever and impactful whilst still existing in a galaxy far far away with lazer guns, space ships, talking robots and aliens. It looks and feels like Star Wars without being silly and childish. It is effective without subverting the tropes and conventions of the cinematic universe in which it exists.  Unsurprisingly it feels similar to Rogue One but it may actually also be its superior. Andor is 'right up there's with The Empire Strikes Back and (along with Rogue One) is easily the high point of anything released since the greatest sequel in cinematic history was released all the way back in 1980. It is easily the best SW Disney+ TV show if you are over the age of 14. Such a shame that this wasn't the tone, character development, acting, dialogue and aesthetic of the prequel and sequel trilogies.  If you haven't seen Andor. Watch it. Now.",10,positive

The best casting compared the the rubbish in season 1. I am so glad they followed it up. Looking forward to what they do in season 3.  Skip season 1 go straight to season 2.  There is no way the people involved in season1 had anything to do with this. The views of Italy alone are worth the watch.",9,positive

"#SixSeasonsAndAMovie please!  Netflix, pick this series up for more episodes because holy cow, you hit it out of the park this time.  Ortega is PERFECT as Wednesday, I loved her in X and I love her in this.  The title says it all: WEDNESDAY! This is her picture, her character always steals the scenes both on the small screen and in the Tim Burton films, this series time jumps us to her late teens and hits the ground running with mysteries, adventure, and spooky macabre humor.  Tim Burton directs the first four episodes, and the score is by Danny Elfman!  I am enamored with this series and can't wait for it to get picked up for more seasons, and the potential spin offs of the other lesser featured (this is Wednesday's show of focus, after all) should get fans hyped for an eventual Addams cinematic universe using this cast. The casting is perfect across the board, and I love Christna Ricci's character, such a sweet nod to the OG!",6,neutral
"Heard great things about this show, and now they started showing it here in France, so I gave it a shot. I really like it - The Cowboy/horses/ business setting is a refreshing touch after years of shows that all look the same. The writing is REALLY good - great lines one after another! The actors really get something to play with here, and I am really impressed by the way Kelly Reilly does her character. I read in the reviews how many of you absolutely HATE her, but I think you are just letting the characters antipathy affect your view of the actress - she does an amazing job!  Also really like Luke Grimes - there is a lot of sensitivity in him, like a younger Jeremy Renner. Of course Kevin Costner is brilliant as always. And Cole Houser playing Rip - real classic western vibe from him - could hold one of those 60's westerns all alone with a horse, no problem.  My mother didn't like the show - ""too much violence"". But she likes the Bold and the Beautiful, so , no comparison... I am just on the beginning of season 2 (tonight!), and I will stick around as long as it goes. I have only seen ""Hell or high water"" from Tyler Sheridan, and some bits of Wind river, but it would seem the guy has special skills and always delivers a true style - just like Quentin Tarantino.  People dont like the woke messaging that surfaces from time to time - well, guys, this is TV in the era of Biden, what do you want?

"I rented the original movie on VCR, and first read the book over 20 years ago. I like how the story has been updated in a way that is current, complex, and allows the series to continue. I like that when I'm watching the series, I don't know exactly what is going to happen.  I don't like the way the IMDB page for the series is set up. If you go the page for the 1990 movie, Margaret Atwood is given credit at the top of the page as the writer of the novel. The only place you find her name on the front page for the series is at the very bottom of the page in the trivia, or you can drill down and find her name in the episode writing credits. Margaret Atwood gave us this story and her name should be up front.",6,neutral

"Get ready for a captivating and thought-provoking journey with ""White Lotus"" on HBO Max. This exceptional TV show is a must-watch for anyone looking for something fresh and exciting, featuring captivating characters and exceptional acting that will keep you engaged from start to finish.

The combination of breathtaking cinematography, excellent acting, and masterful storytelling makes it one of the best shows currently available.

"Wednesday is a Netflix series, MGM Film production based on the Adam's Family characters. Jenna Ortega played Wednesday Adams as a student who has been expelled from various schools till she is moved to Nevermore Academy. Even at the academy she was treated as an outcast till she learns through her psychic abilities that a fellow student was murdered by a Hyde, which is a human who turns into a monster. Gwendoline Christie played Principal Larissa who is a changling. Catherine Zeta-Jones played Morticia Adams and Luis Guzman as Gomez Adams, they could have picked better actors to act as her parents. Christina Ricci had a small role to play where she was the original Wednesday character in a previous movie. Jamie McShane played the town sheriff where a slew of murders took place and body parts go missing from the city morgue that would help resurrect the original Pilgrim that tried to get all the monsters killed. Hunter Doohan played the sheriff's son who falls for Wednesday or is he actually trying to keep her close? Fred Armisen played charismatic thief Uncle Fester. This murder mystery script was directed by Tim Burton, produced by Alfred Ghough who was behind Smallville, and composed by Burton's best friend Danny Elfman and Chris Bacon. This was a great series reminded me of Harry Potter type of movie but darker. Definitely add this to your list.",8,positive

Absolutely well written screenplay and highly grounded approach to action sequences.",9,positive
"I was excited about Ortega playing this role. She'll do it well. Zeta-Jones is perfect for the role as well. Guzman is the worst possible choice for the role of Gomez. Gomez Addams was never a repulsively ugly and creepy character. The original Gomez may not have been insanely handsome, but he wasn't repulsive. He was debonair, suave and still good looking. He didn't make you cringe when he obsessively fawned over Morticia. This actor is just slimy, creepy and repulsive for this role.  As far as Pugsley goes, I have nothing against the actor. He seems fine. What I have an issue with is the writing of his character being emotional and weak. Pugsley was never a crybaby. I fully expect this to be dark and twisted (after all, it IS Burton and that IS what the public craves) so it should be well done.

"Although Andor takes its time building its world and intrigue in the end it's time well spent.  By the time Season 1 concludes we have the basis for a great series - a Star Wars universe with some grit and determination beginning the fight back against imperial over-reach and aggression.  This is proper Sci-Fi - something I think the Star Wars movies have ironically and somewhat inexplicably struggled with - perhaps due to scale and the notion of blockbusters needing to be so enormous that in the end it's detail that suffers. But Andor is carefully realised, it has the elements of human drama and enough of the Sci-Fi content to remind us where we are and what's being fought against. Having said that, the portrayals of the Empire are perhaps a little too 1-dimensionally fascist.  Now it's time for Andor to change up a gear for season 2.",3,negative

"This show is exactly like the books. Nothing quite makes sense and the dialogue somewhere between cringeworthy and laugh out loud. I heard the author interviewed and he said that he starts writing on September 1, without an outline, without any research, just types away. If you have ever read these books you will know that sounds about right. As for the show, the guy playing Reacher is perfect (the anti Tom Cruise). Just sit back, relax and suspend disbelief and you will have a good time watching this.",9,positive
Don't listen to critics this show was brilliant. Can not wait for season 2 which has already been confirmed by Netflix,10,positive
"Its honestly crazy that the writers for the later seasons wanted to make Geralt and Cerie (the child he rescues in the first season and helps raise for the next several) have a romantic relationship so Henry Cavill departed from the show. Who knows if they are going to continue with that trash storyline but it should be said this show was good enough to make my wife (who could care less about fantasy) interested for the first two seasons. The show has taken a downward turn since then though those first two seasons are quite enjoyable with a great cast and honestly great effects. The monster fights are next level and the sword fights are even better so thats why I say it deserves 10/10, plus Cavill is the man and the rest of the cast make this such a great show.",9,positive
"This is obviously an American centric production because hello, the rest of the world doesn't care nor live based on these ""issues"". This show is boring, we are just witnessing some people's lives, the only thing that connects them is the hotel place. Ok I got it it's about the rich elite being awful and socialism for everyone ok cool cool. Still, it's a boring show, I don't get the hype at all. Therefore, the 15 minutes of Jennifer Coolidge (?) is up I think. Don't know how the Hollywood (the rich elite lol) pushed her back and suddenly she is everywhere. These characters are all getting similar amounts of screen time idk why they chose to shine her at the awards.",9,positive
"Good acting, characters really nailed their roles. Humor & ridiculousness. Really well put together show. We hope season 2 is almost as good.",10,positive
"The biggest reason I was hesitant to watch Wednesday was because of what it was advertised as. It's pretty hard to do a respectable job with a young adult property let alone produce a good one. There's been so many attempts, anything geared towards teenagers is almost forced to parody itself just to dodge people overtly giggling and smirking at it. Wednesday doesn't avoid all the pitfalls but I was pleasantly surprised that it navigated its way around as many of them as they did. The central mystery was interesting enough that I didn't know outright guess it halfway through and although I'm not the biggest Tim Burton fan (I like some of his work, other projects... not so much) his experienced hand and Gothic sensibilities are perfect for this budding franchise. Despite the occasional misstep, I was impressed at how the show kept up the pace and didn't become too rote after each adventure with Wednesday. The creative team may not have created the new Citizen Kane but there was effort put into the story here and I appreciated that.  Instead of the whole Addams Family being at the forefront, we focus on the titular Wednesday as the protagonist and there's a lot of work put into understanding her mindset at this point in her life. She's a sullen and angry teenager but she's also got a razor sharp wit and a passion for seeking out the truth in her surroundings. I do think they sanded off a couple of the sharper edges from previous versions of the character (the jokes she tells are similar but she's less edgy in her interactions with others), but it was a necessary sacrifice as she needs to at least be semi-approachable by her classmates and other members of the Nevermore community. As much as her rebellious streak could have been annoying or cliche, the writers frame it as her wanting to step out of Morticia and Gomez's shadows and forge her own identity. She's still suitably prickly, but much like the Grinch, her heart grows a couple of sizes by the end of the initial season. Some of the supporting characters are given some nice mini-arcs like learning to stand up for yourself (Eugene), learning to accept yourself for who you are and live your best life (Enid) and even to let go of bias and preconceived notions and moving forward with an open mind (Sheriff Galpin and Principal Weems). Is it all stuff we've seen before? Perhaps, but it gives the background players some material to chew on while Wednesday skulks around Jericho.  I wasn't thrilled with much of the casting, I grew up watching Raul Gulia, Anjelica Huston and Christina Ricci as the Addams Family but once again, Wednesday left me taken aback. I was swayed by Jenna Ortega's fascinating work as Wednesday. I wasn't familiar with her before this but if she's not a star already, this should catapult her to the next level. She gets Wednesday's biting humour and she even brings some physicality to her performance. She's excellent at being stone-faced and motionless while she's interrogating suspects or making biting criticisms of her peers. Gwendoline Christie does a gratifying job of playing against type as Principal Weems, she's a figurehead who's all smiles in front of the cameras but an imposing figure behind the scenes. Gwendoline does a solid job of portraying her duplicitous nature. Christina Ricci (famous for previously playing Wednesday Adams) is a nice bit of casting as Marilyn Thornhill. She's very sweet and convincing as a sympathetic ear to Wednesday and it was fun to see her again in this property. Luis Guzman and Catherine Zeta Jones grew on me as Gomez and Morticia. Zeta-Jones was the standout of the 2 but they both got the strange beat that Gomez and Morticia dance to together as they fawn over each other in every single moment. I'd also like to credit Emma Myers, Hunter Doohan and Joy Sunday respectively for their work as Enid, Tyler and Bianca. All 3 of them had some standout moments and were good in their supporting roles.  While Wednesday is certainly intriguing and is raised above the normal fair by its excellent lead performance, the material itself is cribbed from a lot of other YA properties. It's faithful to the Addams Family spirit but the teenage private eye angle, the school for outcasts, the separate social clubs/houses are all either borrowed from previous series like Riverdale or successful movie properties like Harry Potter. Any effort in the genre is going to have similarities but even when explaining parts of the show to my family, their comments were ""okay, so just like __________?"" The only retort I could offer is that while it does ""borrow"" many bits and pieces, Wednesday does it well enough that you can almost forget/forgive them for it. But I have watched my fair share of YA material and these thoughts were still present in my mind as I binge watched every episode.  I got a lot more out of Wednesday than I expected to and I'm happy to applaud it for that. I'm not in the target audience but due to the efforts of Ortega and the cast, the great Gothic atmosphere, an adequate central mystery and some chuckle worthy jokes, I was happy I took the time despite my reservations. Wednesday may not be wholly original but it's still an upper tier entry in a genre that's best days are long since past. I'd be happy to watch a 2nd season for sure. Wednesday is plenty creepy, kooky, mysterious and spooky enough to justify your time on Netflix.",10,positive
"Because of the Goo Goo Muck dance now going vial on TikTok made us watch this show on Netflix, we both felt this was a very compelling story line and an amazing cast (well most of them). The casting of Morticia played by Zeta-Jones was so wrong, very poor actress with the addition of Gomez played by Guzman was also poorly placed. The rest of the cast were amazing, my favourites besides the amazing actor Ortega, with the other being Joy Sunday (Bianca), she is a joy to watch and just mesmerising actor. I cannot wait for season 2 to watch this pair work together again. The story and plot twist were very good and does give you quite a bit to think about, the jokes and quips were very good, and they do make you giggle or cringe depending on how they were devised. Can I wait for season 2, not really, wish it was here right now.",10,positive
"My husband and I can never agree on a show to watch together, and this was a win from both of us. We weren't too particularly happy with how the last season ended, but hey what more can you do with a pandemic? The show as a whole though was FANTASTIC. So much so that I'm rewatching it while I'm on medical leave from my job. So far I've only completed the first episode of my binge re-watch, but I'm already sucked back in. If you're just bored and looking for something to do, I highly recommend. Cillian Murphy absolutely killed this role, and very quickly became one of my favorite actors with his diversity.",9,positive

"With the exception of Lydia Deetze there was no character I could really identify with growing up. I grew up watching reruns of the Munsters and the Addams Family, but Wednesday was a child. A show like ""Wednesday"" would've been an instant hit with me and my friends. I love watching it now with my kids and seeing them say ""mom! She dresses like you!! She's allergic to color! Hahaha!"" I hope this show gives birth to some genuine baby bats.

"The first thing that struck me was the brother being locked up in the lockers and began crying because of it. The sad part is he enjoys pain, and torture. So he would actually enjoy what happen to him. It's really a show that lives off the fake idea that girls are stronger the boys. It's a weak story and bland one at that. Bad casting and how's her father that Hispanic and she doesn't hav one characteristics of being Hispanic.  It's a bad wanna be Adam's family spin off and personally want My time back. If I had a case I'd sue Netflix for destroying my child with this horrible show.  Give credit to anyone who can sit and watching nightmare.",10,positive

"Just watch it. Its addicting from day 1. Moral compass and stuff like that. Great characters. Specially in season 3. Seasons 1& 2 are nothing like the season 3. So if you dont like season 1 and 2 you actually might like season 3.  Okay. It might be boring in the beginning. And Yes the two first seasons might be bad but i want you to try the third seasons. Its so amazing its not even close to the old seasons.  The third seasons is more about the spritual. Its just amazing. Please just watch it and try to give it your own mening, dont listen to everyone else and be a ""sheep in a sheep-hird"".  Regards from Norway.",9,positive
"I don't have a lot of time to watch television, less time to devote to a series. With that said, the first episode has to grab my attention. Sadly this one did not. The characters were dull and the plot seemed to lack momentum. I'm sure some people will say ""Oh it really gets good by episode 5"", but I'm getting tired of seeing about 2 hours of decent entertainment stretched across 10 episodes.  Disney seems to be missing the target by a wide margin lately, especially with Marvel. Obi-Wan was fantastic but this one fell flat for me.  Perhaps when all the episodes drop I'll try to binge watch it on a free weekend.",10,positive
"I still remember the first time I saw season 1 of the show. I was absolutely blow away by the subject. With each episode I felt more and more uncomfortable and scared but also drawn to the show! I love both the seasons and it's absolutely brilliant writing!! What I also love is the back stories of almost all the main characters, which gives them so much depth and layering. Also, great acting!!",10,positive
"I literally couldn't sleep last night, I was too excited for this. It's 6:30 am EST and I've already watched it twice.  The first 20 minutes I felt moved along a little fast but the episode settled into a great groove once it got going.  Cinematography, special effects and sets were 100% Star Wars but my jury is still out on the musical score.  Overall a great start especially considering the high level of expectations that come along with the first ever non-animated Star Wars TV series.",7,neutral
"The show is vgood at keeping interest and the visual impact is extraordinary.  There is a lot of room for ""things to happen"".  However:  The characters are very flawed and not very appealing. It is hard to find anything appreciably admirable in any of the characters. Greed, power, cruelty, duplicity, corruption, and megalomania seem to rule the day.  The people depicted in the show are...well.... convincing in their deficits and excesses, and demonstrate the sickness that ties of blood (family) can produce.  The most disturbing fact is that the characters in Yellowstone are quite believable ...they seem every bit as insane as the caricatured cast of ""Dallas"" (old evening soap opera), without the parody, hyperbole and humor of that old show. We ""knew"" the Dallas characters were a parody of themselves.  The Yellowstone characters, on the other hand, are not exaggerations, they are not parodies, they are not hyperbolic, they are, in fact, ""dead"" serious.  A story well told, but not one that allows any feeling of goodness or redemption, or even hope, to surface in the face of the ugly qualities on display from nearly every corner of the screen. Maybe my misgivings are that it is all a bit too real, too raw, and too contemporary.  All this does not make it a bad work, just not an easy watch.",9,positive
"It took 2 episodes for me to skip all the rest. It's awful. It could have been good . Just replace the music, the stupid style, the cameraman. All those comparing this with Boardwalk , well open your eyes. Boardwalk was at least believable, had music that did fit and the acting and pacing was perfect even if being slow, because at that time there was still time available in life. Now they make a show which does reflects the same time-frame with music that does not fit and use stylistic camera-work that does not fit. What is worse is the overacting. Everybody is trying so hard.This is bad directing as well. There is so much talent on the floor and it is used in a wrong way. No sorry, not for me.",10,positive
It's only been on for two episodes and I have NO idea what this show is supposed to be about because it's so damn BORING I'm not even sure I'd care if I did know. The only thing I know is that ALL of the characters are deplorable and I hope they all somehow get killed.,5,neutral
"The Last of Us is a masterpiece that brilliantly brings the acclaimed video game to life on the small screen. The show captivates from the very first episode with its stunning cinematography, intense storytelling, and deeply emotional performances. The chemistry between the lead actors is palpable, making the journey through a post-apocalyptic world feel incredibly real and heart-wrenching. The attention to detail in the set design and special effects is remarkable, creating an immersive experience that stays true to the source material while offering fresh surprises for fans and newcomers alike. Every episode is a testament to high-quality storytelling, making ""The Last of Us"" a must-watch for anyone who appreciates powerful drama and thrilling adventure.",10,positive
"The show is absolutely awesome and is in my Top 3 best shows ever. Thomas Shelby is a sight for sore eyes. I was absolutetly amazed by his performance. The Cast is phenomenal as Tom hardy is also there. The characters are well written and the Show as is good as it gets. We get to see Jurassic Park's Sam Neil, He's a strong character. I am eagerly waiting for Season 6 and the script is also written for it but the production has halted due to Pandemic.",10,positive
"A centrist view of the Addams family designed to not offend and to average out competing expectations.  Plot was a bit slow and weak as well as unnecessarily convoluted. Luis great as Gomez, Morticia not so much, but who can touch Ms. Huston's portrayal anyway. Unfortunately the main acting problem is actually Wednesday herself. I think the script and or the direction made her too strident, not enough of the fantastic dead pan we saw with Ms. Rici.. Also Wednesday's interest were never so conventional, and teen angsty. Trying to appeal to the widest possible audience I suppose under the guise of well she is older now? I don't know. Just not a good switch from her esoteric almost random interest and penchants to a laser focused Nancy drew. Doesn't fit character or the Addams in general.  Let the haters begin, this is just my opinion and I am still glad to have seen it and recommend it. Just don't think it is all that and that it could have been made much better with out too much being done differently.  I respect other point of view.",6,neutral
"I did not care about this show at all. Nothing about it interested me. I did not find it funny, and didn't think it was well written. The only reason I was curious to know what happened was to understand how people were enjoying it so much. Knowing how it all turned out, I still don't get it. I think that people will sit through just about anything if it is on tv and looks nice.",4,negative

"It makes me wonder if younger generations have been beat down so much with banality, that they like insipid, predictable stories.  I see 8 stars for a boring series like Mandalorian (sp?). Maybe it's baby Yoda that gets it all those stars?  One of the main appeals of the original Star Wars was how it constantly introduced new and interesting worlds and characters. These new Star Wars movies/series just rehash.  Andor looks like the set of Mandalorian. It almost feels like they used the name Andor because it sounds like Mandalorian. So nothing new here.  The Andor story is better. I'll give it that. But it's not that great.  Also, it feels like I'm watching Dr Who or the BBC. Just 2nd rate writing with predictable outcomes.  Honestly, I haven't seen any Star Wars movie or series that I've really liked since the originals. Rehash and terrible stories. Meh. This does more, maybe because of Adria Ajorna and finally having a nice woman to look at.  But it's all so contrived. Like when they overtake the prison and manage to find a rack full of guns. Uh, what happened to the prison guard saying ""you wonder how we can control the prison with no guns?"" when they arrived? LOL. It's like writers are putting this together over pizza and decide ""we prolly need some guns"".  Not to mention the weird and obvious w-oke agenda in this films which is unbearable.  7/10 - better than the rest, with a low bar to hurdle.",6,neutral
"Such an incredible show! Ignore what people say about season 4, I think it's brilliant! The sheer resilience and tenacity of June is fascinating to watch.

"Well the Witcher is back along with Ciri, Yennifer, Triss and the rest.  Its post battle and everyone is licking their wounds. Geralt meets an old friend and a new threat is on the horizon.  The new series begins in a brilliant but dark setting and sets the the tone.  Its fantasy done well, maybe not as jarring or real as GoT but it does stay loyal to ideology of the books. Fans of the games will also enjoy this episode.  A great start to the series.",6,neutral
After watching a few episodes I learned the show is a bit silly at times and shouldn't be taken very seriously. I liked the spooky and isolated atmosphere of the school. There was a good mix of friendly banter and light hearted shenanigans to bring up the mood. The story was intriguing and kept me guessing who the villains were.  At first I was put off by the over top cringey dialogue from the main character. It got less annoying the more I watched but it was still laughably cringey at times. I'm also not into teen dramas but this one was suprisingly enjoyable.  The show reminded me of a mix between Stranger Things and Harry Potter. Not sure if that's a good thing. I lost interest in stranger things after the 1st/2nd season. But to my surprise I found myself bingeing all 8 episodes of Wednesday in only a few days.,9,positive
Great acting from everyone. Compelling story that keeps you coming back for more. A pleasure to watch.,10,positive
"I love this series. However, it's irritating to me that this family has a vendetta with the Italians. Being hunted by the Italians who promise to kill the whole family and yet how many of the Shelby's kept going places alone? Why wouldn't they have bodyguards for everyone everywhere they went? Then Tommy shoots Alfie and doesn't bother to make sure he's dead? Come on... these small things are highly irritating! Still one of the best series ever.",10,positive

"Wow I can't believe I hadn't watched this until recently. Great stories, some more interesting than others - with some of the best Star Wars content since the OT.  Pascal delivers a great performance under the helmet, it surely can't be easy to sell emotion, but he does it, and has easily become one of my favourite characters of the franchise. I wasn't sure if season two would be able to maintain the quality, but it did - for the most part - and ended phenomenally.  Sometimes the episodes can feel a little bit predictable because it tends to be played quite safe and the stakes are not very high, but the visuals, atmosphere and cinematography make up for it. Additionally, each episode is so unique and different from the last, you don't really know what to expect until you've gone into it.",10,positive
"Oh my Woe! As a tv convincer I can personally say that this series was amazing. While there are a few improvements to be made like the CGI of the monster, the ending however was masterfully NOT expected.  Right from the beginning it was clear the casting was on point and the directing was to die for! The mix of comedy, suspense, and dark humor was immaculate. While I will NOT spoil the show for anyone, what you see is not what you woe (you will get the pun after watching it). Not even 10 minutes ago from writing this review, I just finished the 1s 8ep and I'm still shaking. Honestly wish I could be apart of this masterpiece myself but watching it will just have to do.  For anyone curious, you could watch this with a teenager and it, in my opinion, will be a teen friendly adventure. Although, I'd advise parents to watch it to see if their teen could have issues, such as nightmares, etc. It's not scary but it does have perfectly timed jump scares and could frighten a younger child.  In conclusion, this is a must see and one that you will not regret. With it's perfectly timed suspense, dark humor, and great acting, you may want to grab some popcorn, before saying... Woe!",9,positive

"Seems to me the makers of the Reacher contents always get complacent. At first they do something decent and audiences love it, then they managed to ruin it when it comes to the second run.  They just can not understand that Reacher works best when he is alone most of the time. The minute they gave him too much partners, too much help, or the sidecharacters start to goof on him and start to question his intellect or motives then HE LOSES HIS MYSTIQUE and APPEAL.  Also I loved the Bud Spencer - Terence Hillesque fight with the Hells Angels, where each Angel waited for his/her turn, and the two dainty broads in high heels and tight evening dresses (Dixon and Neagley) managed to beat up and kill some of them. Quick editing cuts to mask the insane unrealism of that scene. Gone the great coreography we have seen during the prison fight in Season One. But it was a great scene for laughs, I enjoyed it. Same with the Jack-in-the-Box trick during the car scene in S2 Episode 5 also with these two lovely and gorgeous ladies. It was great comedy, for sure.  Lee Child said in an interview that Reacher is a lonely knight from medieval European chronicles who does good then leaves. So treat him like one. And even if Child wrote novels about him joining a team then lose those novels.",10,positive
"Fabulous scenery; fascinating relationships - addictively so; a nod to everything good and bad about land ownership and values in America. The Dutton family will take you on a crazy ride, and make you question where your own values lie. To own or not to own and at what stakes, regarding the land ownership of the white men and those who should rightfully own it. Powerful female characters who don't give a damn and fight in ways that leave you both uncomfortable and remembering anger fuelled reactions with respect! Here's hoping that life on the ranch and all the hands returns to our screens! Soon!",10,positive

"Not entirely sure what all the hype around this show is... with the exception of one or two cast members the acting is poor, the special effects are laughable, and the storyline is neither great nor terrible, it's just... meh.  I normally love all of tim burton's work and even when i don't, at least from a design and aesthetics perspective, I find it interesting - admittedly, I'm probably not the target audience, my guess is that's more pre-teens and young teens, most likely to around 14 years old.  There are a few decent moments including the famous dance scene, but overall it just seems to be an over-hyped nothingness of a show, which is such a shame because it had so much potential.",9,positive
"I stopped watching after the fourth episode bcs I didn't get convinced by Wednesday's reason to stay at school and play Nancy Drew. Also, I really would like to see scenes from Wednesday's dark deeds as she describes them or just flashbacks, not just empty mentions as if they are gonna make us believe everything she says. If you wanna keep ppl watching then show them the stories. People are here to watch, not listen to tales. Some characters just don't fit the story. Especially Wednesday's roommate. I wish the whole series had been given to Tim Burton to write/direct. Corporate agendas are clearly showing themselves. Pity.",6,neutral
"Very very smart/dark comedy. The rivalry between the resort manager and the rich dude is top notch acting. I found myself laughing throughout most of the episodes. Each character has a running plotline with other resort vacationers and the way their plots intertwine is magnificent. The filming of the show is beautiful as well and if you're anything like me, you will want to upgrade your sunglasses game. The show also gives you vacation MV to the max and will make you wanna book a week at sandals immediately. It took me a long time to try the show, but once you do you will get sucked into this one of a kind show almost instantly.",9,positive
"I kind of knew what I was getting into when I saw Tim Burton and Danny Elfman advertised. So, that part was fairly standard fare, of course very well done. Cinematofraphy was fantastic, lots of zooming and special effects, the costumes were great, as one would expect.  The casting and acting were were much better than I anticipated, particularly from Jenna Ortega - what a wonderful surprise. Luis Guzman, Catherine Zeta Jones, etc. I loved them. I am a little sad Christina Ricci may not be back for another season, but it was great seeing her in this one, afterall she was the the '90's Addams Family. I kind of expect to see Helena Bonham Carter next season.  I rate on expectation and this got a 10 for exceeding. I couldn't find a flaw. I'm sure I'll watch it, again. Very nice to have something so well put together. Thank you!",9,positive

"Kevin Costner is the patriarch presiding over a dynastic ranch that is the size of some countries. His way of life is being impinged on by resort developers, tribal rights, and the authority of the state of Montana. Reminiscent of Rock Hudson in ""Giant"", he is trying to hold on to the old ways.  ""Yellowstone"" develops quickly with little introduction, yet its story unravels with the natural pace of a wilderness day, pausing for tribal rituals, cowboy conventionalities, and political machinations. It's a far flung undertaking that dwells on the seams between laws and justice, family and friendships.  Costner fills his character's boots naturally, it seems. He is a world-wearied man who has seen too much and lied too often. The land and the family are his lifeblood. He can hear the footsteps coming his way, but he can only fulfill his role-out of habit as much as loyalty.  Although some action is a little confusing due to lack of explanation, it feels natural, as if the viewer is getting a genuine slice-of-life glimpse into another world. I hope the resolution of this saga includes an emotional payoff that justifies its breadth and its attention to details.  Update 7/20/18: After four episodes, this series has a strong voice and a persistent rhythm. We learn the fullness of each story, from roots to fruits. I am increasing my grade to ""9"".",9,positive
"Peaky Blinders is nothing short of a revelation in the world of television. This sprawling saga, spanning six seasons, is an absolute masterpiece that weaves an intricate and compelling narrative, leaving viewers utterly captivated from the first frame to the last. It's not just a TV show; it's an immersive experience, a journey into the heart of darkness and power, meticulously crafted to perfection.  At the heart of this brilliance lies an extraordinary story, one that deftly explores the underbelly of post-World War I Birmingham. The tale is steeped in intrigue, politics, crime, and family dynamics, offering viewers an unfiltered look into a world where survival meant navigating a treacherous maze of power struggles and moral ambiguity.  What truly elevates Peaky Blinders to a league of its own are the characters. Richly layered, flawed, and achingly human, they are brought to life by a stellar cast. Cillian Murphy, in particular, delivers a tour de force performance as Thomas Shelby, the enigmatic and charismatic leader of the Shelby crime family. Murphy's portrayal is nothing short of mesmerizing; his piercing gaze and magnetic presence draw viewers in, making it impossible to look away. His character is a brilliant concoction of charm, ruthlessness, and vulnerability, making Thomas Shelby an iconic figure in the pantheon of television characters.  Peaky Blinders is more than just a show; it's an emotional rollercoaster that immerses you so deeply into its world that you become emotionally invested in the fates of these characters. The writing is sharp, the direction is impeccable, and the cinematography is visually stunning, painting a vivid picture of post-war Birmingham.  It's not often that a TV series transcends the boundaries of the small screen to become a cultural phenomenon, but Peaky Blinders has achieved just that. It's a show that leaves an indelible mark on your soul, transforming you into a whole new person by the time the credits roll. Once you start watching, you're hooked; the story grips you, the characters haunt you, and you find yourself eagerly anticipating each twist and turn.  In a fair world, Peaky Blinders would receive a rating beyond conventional measures. While I'm limited to awarding it a perfect 5 out of 5 stars, in my heart, it deserves a thousand stars. It's a show that defies ratings, a true testament to the power of storytelling and masterful craftsmanship.  Peaky Blinders isn't just a television series; it's a work of art, an experience that will resonate with viewers for generations to come. Do yourself a favor and dive headfirst into this gripping tale of ambition, loyalty, and the pursuit of power.

"Season 1 caught my attention and I was hooked. I didn't watch it right away and so was able to watch season 2 not too long after season 1. I thought oh well season 2 must because of the pandemic pause and most shows stumbled coming back. Then season 3 came along and what a load of crap.  How can you have a show called the Witcher and have the Witcher have the least screen time? They might as well have a spinoff called Witchers gang and let them be the spotlight. I heard they did something similar to that and it was horrible so...  They dragged plot points out...The desert was a waste of time. That could have been a 5-10 minute scene. It could have even been introduced as a flashback later in another episode. The ""dancing"" mystery was bad also and was just a time filler. We saw the same scene was it 5 times but different angles? And Yennifer is getting more annoying the more screen time she gets. She is fine in small bites. The same with Ciri but as they become more of a focus you see how they really aren't that interesting.  I never read the books and only played the games. I thought it was going to be like the game with the focus on the Witcher but that was only in season 1. Season 2 they split the focus and season 3 it was like oh yeah...And here's the Witcher...and moving on to Ciri and Yennifer.  I won't bother with season 4 or if I do it will be after sites I trust review it and if it is a bomb I will skip. It if it passable I will give it a shot.",10,positive

"Andor is a masterclass in storytelling, character development, and political nuance that redefines what Star Wars can be.  Unlike anything the galaxy far, far away has delivered before, Andor strips away the spectacle and mythic grandeur of Jedi and Sith to tell a grounded, slow-burn thriller about rebellion, sacrifice, and the oppressive weight of empire. Showrunner Tony Gilroy takes what could have been a simple prequel and transforms it into an urgent, fiercely intelligent exploration of resistance and moral ambiguity.  The writing is razor-sharp. Dialogue is purposeful and layered, echoing real-world political tensions and the personal cost of insurgency. Each arc builds organically, with patient pacing that rewards attentive viewers. It trusts the audience to think. Characters are flawed, deeply human, and morally grey-especially Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), who evolves from self-serving survivor to someone willing to die for an ideal. His journey is both harrowing and profoundly moving.  Stellan Skarsgård's Luthen Rael is an instant classic. His monologue about the loneliness and cost of leadership is one of the greatest speeches in Star Wars history. Genevieve O'Reilly's portrayal of Mon Mothma adds aching layers to a character once seen only in passing. Denise Gough's Dedra Meero is terrifying in her competence, and Kyle Soller's Syril Karn brings a chilling portrait of authoritarian obsession.  The cinematography and score are moody and immersive, supporting a tone that feels more Blade Runner than A New Hope. Practical sets, minimal reliance on CGI, and a commitment to emotional realism make Andor feel lived-in and tangible.  Andor doesn't rely on nostalgia. It earns its place as the most mature, politically charged, and emotionally resonant entry in the Star Wars canon. It's not just good Star Wars-it's phenomenal television.",10,positive
"Entertaining and relaxing to watch. Some beautiful music and scenes every episode. It's nice with a well scripted, thought out story, and actors who pull it off great. All except Jennifer Coolidge are great. I just don't get why she is even in it, all other characters stories get mixed between each other, and she is just out on the side being cringy and annoying. And I guess you can say that's the role she was given, but I feel like that's all she ever is. And I have absolutely no idea why they would bring her back for season 2 as the only one... Hope for a season 3, with complete new cast, and a new location obviously.",4,negative
The somber melancholy science backdrop is subtle and terrifying in a slowburn gripping fashion. I have not played the game but I really want to now. And the casting is spot on with Pedro's selection. The writing is fantastic and the CGI and cinematography is beautiful and haunting. It's hard not to believe that this is not an accurate portrayal of a possible dystopian future in our cards. And I just saw a WSJ article citing the scientific concern about global warming increasing the threat of fungus to humanity through adaptation. I've watched each episode multiple times and seem to get something new each time.,8,positive
Story is quit well. Story build up is from first episode engage you with the series well.. Every characters done their job very well. Ending is good but not as hope before. But i would say the detailing of every characters is not well defined. School detailing is quite poor. Overall it will entertain you a lot. You will enjoy your time watching the show. The character Wednesday played by jenna ortega is very very good. Jenna Ortega blossoms her character. But the other characters are not written as expected from the first episode of the series. But if you have time to watch you will surely entertained.,8,positive

"Brilliant series. Totally captivating. But...what on earth was going on with season 4? The writing was bad and Adrien Brody's hammy acting laughable. Despite that major wobble, this is still one of the best series ever. Cillian Murphy is a star always finding the right tone for Tommy. It takes a great actor to make us feel empathetic towards what is a monster of a character. Arthur is another standout part brilliantly portrayed by Paul Anderson. And the music is a real highlight - PJ Harvey, Radiohead/Thom Yorke/The Smile, Anna Calvi, Gabriel Yared/Sinead O'Connor among personal highlights. Highly recommend.",9,positive
"I don't think it captures the Addams family spirit entirely, but it's still a great show! I absolutely loved it and watched it all in one sitting. I wasn't sure about the casting at first, and I still don't think they're as good as previous actors, who held the roles, but they still do a great job.  This rendition of Wednesday shows a bit more feeling than I had expected, wich threw me off at first, but it ended up working out well with the story.  The plot and the atmosphere overall is excellent, it is dark, twisted, and comical. On top of that, it was great to watch a show in wich the ending wasn't painfully obvious right from the start. They threw in some nice twists and turns.",9,positive
Episode one sold me I was in for a new Stars Wars universe adventure. Each succeeding episode has gotten less and less interesting.  Not showing our hero's face may make the marketing of the Mandalorian exponentially easier on a global scale--only requiring the helmeted protagonist to change languages from country to country. But where's the story? What drives him? What hurts still eat at him? What love has he lost? Who does he hate?  Land on planet. Laser blast battle. Protect baby Yoda.

"I'll watch Henry as Geralt for the 3rd season but then that's it for me. I've never seen the main star not given what he wants to stay before. I mean Tom Cruise became the Executive Producer of MI and Top Gun, same for Ryan Reynolds and Deadpool. They should have just made Henry ahead of the project and let him make the decisions instead of losing him. Because I severely doubt the show will make it with Liam unless they go a younger version of Geralt I guess, then maybe it could hang for a season, but that's about it. Which is a shame because the production design wasn't bad. The casting choices were way too woke for my Slavic tastes but most did an adequate enough acting job perhaps. So basically Henry carried the entire thing.",8,positive
"Because while I liked it I didn't love it! This would have been something I would of liked to take my daughter to see when she was a tween, I didn't really like how any of the Adams were cast whilst Catherine Zeta Jones looked amazing she was hit or miss in her acting. I love Luis Guzman but don't think that was a part he was really suited for and the guy who played uncle Fester( don't know his name) was awful! And as for Wednesday(Jenna Ortega) I wasn't thrilled with her! Her acting is very one note. Christina Rcci was much better as was the cast of the 90's movie. Any ways this was entertaining enough. The costumes, filming etc was done well and I did enjoy it. It's a decent watch for the evening and much better than most of the recent series releases on netflix.",6,neutral
"Peaky Blinders is more than just another period crime drama-it's a cinematic experience that immerses you in the raw, smoky streets of post-WWI Birmingham. While many shows explore themes of crime, power, and family, few do so with the same level of style, depth, and emotional resonance. Over six meticulously crafted seasons, it has earned its place among the greatest series of all time.  The show's brilliance lies in its ability to transport you into its world. Each episode is a masterclass in atmosphere, with stunning cinematography, period-accurate costumes, and a haunting soundtrack that blends modern rock with 1920s grit. You don't just watch Peaky Blinders-you feel it. You walk alongside the Shelbys, breathe the industrial air of Birmingham, and get lost in the smoky haze of ambition and betrayal.  At the heart of it all is Thomas Shelby, portrayed with chilling precision by Cillian Murphy. Tommy is one of television's most fascinating characters-a war-scarred strategist whose intelligence and emotional complexity make him unforgettable. His evolution from street-level gangster to political power player is both thrilling and tragic, and Murphy's performance anchors every twist and turn  What sets Peaky Blinders apart is its consistency. There's not a single filler episode; each one is tightly written, emotionally charged, and essential to the overarching narrative. The final season delivers a powerful and thought-provoking conclusion, leaving you with a sense of closure yet longing for more.  I've rewatched the series three times over the past six years, and each viewing has been as impactful as the first. It never loses its edge or emotional weight. Peaky Blinders isn't just a show-it's an experience that stays with you long after the credits roll.",10,positive

".. and this is one of those times. The Last of Us is great in every possible way.  This show is based on a video game, but it is by far the best of its kind. The story (about how fungi took over the human mind) while kind of out there, is the true definition of good sci-fi.  The storytelling is very edge-of-your-seat. I am not aware of the video game but it is clear that the story line have been thought out very very well, and will stand the test of time without any plot holes.  Acting and atmosphere and production are very good as well. Its been a long while since I actually look forward to watching something.  There are so many other shows about zombies but those are as mindless and empty as the brains of the zombies watching them.",8,positive
"I don't even know where to start... it's way over hyped. It's definitely not as great as advertised and talked about. I finished the whole first series before reviewing so I could make sure I wasn't missing something.  Season 1 The characters are truly hateable, really cringy, and awful. I guess props to the actors for making me hate their characters. The couple of characters you didn't hate you felt so bad for. I wanted to punch the daughter Olivia in the boob for being the worst. Just rich people being ""normal"" which is us regular folks ""worst"".  Also the music was so irritating. Too loud, too often, annoying.  I was constantly questioning why I kept watching but I just did, I binged in ONE DAY! Overall I can't decide if it was awful or genius.  Here goes season 2.  So much worse than season one, definitely not genius as other have reviewed. The characters weren't as cringy but not at all likable (probably the point). Definitely did not binge in one day, I had to force myself to keep watching and it did not want to make me visit Italy.  I have nothing good to say about season 2.  The music in was annoying AGAIN. It was like watching ""regular tv"" when a commercial would come on and it's 90% louder, annoying.  I guess the only good thing I can say is the acting was great. The actors truly made me dislike their characters.",10,positive

The guy coming to take out Jacks trash? Ohhh he's actually a Navy Seal dont mess with him!  Jacks accountant? She'll use her CIA contacts to find out the super villains secret plan!

"Unlike most people (it seems), I liked the Tom Cruise movies. Once you got past the size problem (which, admittedly, wasn't easy), I thought Cruise portrayed the Reacher character quite well: great fighter and better shot; terse, yet funny and flirtatious; rigidly nomadic and spartan; loyal to his friends; merciless to his enemies.  Alan Ritchson brings the size everyone wanted, and gets most of the Reacher character. But he speaks in such a monotone, machine-gun manner and fails to make eye contact consistently in a way that made me think they were putting Reacher on the spectrum. The intense gaze that unsettles people is a Reacher hallmark. Ritchson looks more like he's taking an eye exam. Also, he has a surprisingly short stride for someone his size, so he walks like a robot (or an animated comic book hero). After season 1, I said that hopefully in future seasons, he'll loosen up just a little and show a little more charm and empathy. I've been disappointed in subsequent seasons/episodes. A combination of worse writing and Ritchson's lack of development inhabiting Jack Reacher make the first season the high-water mark for the series.  One nagging (and possibly spoiling) goof: In the season 1, episode 8 flashback scene where Reacher and his brother go to their dying mother, Reacher gets meticulously attired in his full dress uniform but still sports the same 5 o'clock shadow and unbrushed hair as in the rest of the show. No career military officer, or loving son visiting his dying mother, would take such care for his outfit and then ignore his grooming.",6,neutral
"The tagline says it all, don't go expecting anything less than a male soap opera but it's a great male soap opera. I love the way we feel like we're on the ranch and what it means to be a cowboy. Special appearances by Taylor Sheridan make for popcorn enjoyment. I have no clue how he writes these episodes so quickly but the authenticity he puts into them and charm is head and shoulders above other shows on TV. The only downfalls on the show are Beth is entirely unrealistic. She's almost like the daughter that a dad wished was a son but in this case it's the actresss that the writer writes as a male. Nothing wrong with that and the actress that plays Beth makes it her own. Jamie is incredibly weak, so much so that you want to slap him too. Great show, will continue watching!",10,positive
"I was so surprised at how kiddyish this show was. I knew it would be a generic Netflix show with their typical style and flavours restricting it from being anything too original, but I didn't know just how ""Young Adult"" and silly it would be. I guessed every single twist and every single reason for everything and I wasn't even trying. It was all too obvious. The monster looked laughable, and the drama... Honestly this show reminded me of Stargirl or something else from the CW. It's rated 15+ but it's just SO kiddyish and silly. The character Wednesday has had everything interesting and kooky about her stripped away and now she's just some Daria clone who just talks without emotion and has no other defining character trait. This looked and felt way too silly for a show supposed to be for older teens and adults. It's feels like a show that was made for a 13 year old girl. Extremely unsatisfying show that took everything fun and kooky about Addams family and just made a Netflix cookie cutter Riverdale/Stargirl clone that is predictable as heck, and insanely kiddyish.  Ps. Take a shot every time someone says 'Patriarchy' in this show or any other Netflix produced series, and you'd be dead. Bonus shots for 'mansplaining' to really seal the deal. Seriously, Netflix is cringe.",10,positive
"The Handmaid's Tale is a quality show. Very good story but I must say. The story is a borrowed story. In reality this is the story of African-American slaves repackaged. The things that happened in the fantasy world of Gilead REALLY happened to African-American men and women, in America, from 1619 to well into the 20th century. Let's be clear about that.

"Movies/Series and Video Games are entirely different realms, so what works in a game cannot be translated 100% to the screen, as certain aspects are too rooted in gaming. However, ""The Last of Us"" managed to translate the story almost fully while adding some additional elements to enhance the gaming experience, even including nods to the players through visuals and dialogue.  Video game adaptations have generally not been well-received, partially due to creators not fully respecting the original source material and only adapting the most compelling parts without proper build-up. On the other hand, gamers are a challenging audience to please; even if a video game is well-made and captivating, they may still find something to criticize or nitpick, as perfection is hard to achieve.  Character portrayal is another critical aspect when transitioning from game to screen, and ""The Last of Us"" excelled in seamlessly bringing the characters to life, albeit with a slightly different approach. The main leads, Joel (played by Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (played by Bella Ramsey), did an outstanding job embodying their personalities while adding their unique touch. Joel is portrayed with less roughness compared to the game, yet his sense of distrust is evident when facing unfamiliar situations. Through Ellie, he begins to ease up and understands the importance of trust on their journey. Ellie, closer to her game counterpart, expresses heightened emotions throughout the episodes, although some game scenes were omitted either due to time constraints or their incompatibility with the show's narrative, leading to a partial loss of character depth.  Regarding pacing, certain episodes could have been improved by adding a midpoint episode for deeper explanations and another at the finale, possibly extending to two episodes. The ""infected"" were introduced at exactly the right time, and although their portrayal differed from the game, it worked well in the context of the show. However, it might have been more beneficial to maintain them as a continuous focal point throughout the series, as they added an element of dread and uncertainty to each conversation, even in seemingly safe environments.  ""The Last of Us"" proves that adaptations can be successful and serve as an entry point for new audiences to fall in love with this universe, while still catering to long-time fans since 2013. The infamous ""video game curse"" has plagued many potential franchise starters, causing them to falter without much consideration. While it may exist for some, others have seen success with adaptations like ""Castlevania"" or ""Arcane"" (based on League of Legends) and more. Let's break free from this curse and create more sophisticated stories based on video games, even if it means altering gameplay mechanics to suit the narrative.  In light of this, most first-party games on the PS4 and now PS5 could be adapted for the big or small screen, as they often resemble long action films in their structure, providing ample potential for adaptation.  Looking ahead, we anticipate upcoming video game adaptations such as ""Fallout"" and ""God of War,"" with more constantly being greenlit. However, it is crucial not to over-saturate the genre and risk it becoming the next Western movie genre fiasco.",10,positive

"I've read a few reviews about how this is timely because of what is happening in America. This is accurate, but it wasn't my first thought.  I'm a ""student"" of North Korea, in the sense that I'm a layperson who has become rather well read on the subject. If you want to understand how the average person in North Korea lives and feels, watch this show. The public executions, the heavily patrolled borders, the ritualized public and private behavior, the rigid hierarchy, and the utter lack of free speech come to mind. It's important to draw this type of analogy, because it's easy to look at this show and think of how utterly impossible it would be in modern times. 25 Million people in North Korea are dealing with this type of evil totalitarianism, and it is arguably worse than the Handmaid's Tale.  This is a dark show, with heavy emotional content. If you want something to escape and forget about your life, this probably isn't it. In the first episode, I felt things that hit me harder than I anticipated, and it didn't let up. I imagine that for most of my fellow women, this show will be difficult to watch at times.  Let's get to the review though: -The cinematography is beautiful. It manages a surreal, ghostly type of feel. It is very distinct, and the look of the show complements the story perfectly. -The writing is nothing short of perfect. In addition to the social issues this show addresses, the writers have a great deal of skill with the simple craft of writing. This is not true of the majority of shows. For example, ""Dear White People"" deals with issues of prejudice and oppression, but the writers haven't mastered the basics.  What does this mean in practice? The Handmaid's Tale featured a simple game of Scrabble between Offred/June and the Commander. Instead of being boring, I was literally on the edge of my seat, because the scene was fraught with tension, suspense, and mystery.  None of the characters are all bad. There are countless moments of compassion for Serena Joy, Offred/June's (arguably main) opponent. Even though I hate her for tormenting Offred/June, I understand her plight. She helped create a movement that ended up harming her, and she's terribly conflicted about that.  I'm surprised at how nuanced the Commander is, and I love what they do with his character. He's kind to Offred/June. He enjoys her company. Obviously, he's one of the chief antagonists of the show, because he is actively oppressing people.  But I think this is deeper than that. This show explores, quite effectively, the harmful impact that sexism has on women, and men too.  Even Aunt Lydia has moments of caring for some of the girls.  The point is, they could have created one dimensional villains and left it at that. Instead, they chose to humanize the villains, and the conflict is riveting.",4,negative
"Season after season, this series finds it way to startle and disturb. Imaginative and devious, this series is based on the Booker winner by the same name.

It will force you to question your role in modern day society and if we are aiding a journey towards the dystopian world of Atwood, which is terrifying. A must watch!",9,positive
"I watched this series week by week. I think I would have liked it better as a complete binge on HBOMax. Either way, I find this to be a very good series about vacationers in the loveliest of spots, ""The White Lotus"".  It starts with a mystery: who is in the box/casket being taken off the plane. From the first two episodes, I didn't care as this was the most annoying group of people on vacation I ever saw.  However, each week as it progressed, it started revealing what this was - and I find that it's stories of people on vacation in a beautiful place, whose messed up lives followed them.  The idea of a vacation is to ""relax"", ""unwind"", leave all that mess behind. These people came with issues, and those the issues ran throughout the vacation. Is there anyone here to root for? Not really. Is there anyone ""likeable""? Uh, not really. Dark comedy? Deep, dark comedy. But that is a Director and Writer Mike White's trait in many of his films. His characters are quirky, strange - but beneath it all there is realness in them.  The cast, all of them, are wonderful in pulling this uncomfortable look into the lives of vacationers. I am one of those folks who falls for the fairy tale version of vacations because up until this, I didn't think about the emotional 'baggage' people brought with them. I automatically assumed they left that where they came from. Not these folks. This is a kinda reminder.  As an example, one cast of characters vacation life I am really interested in watching, the newlyweds, is my nightmare come true. Momma comes to visit. Yes, visit them on their honeymoon. Just popped right on in. No call - just showed the heck up. That's as much of a spoiler as I am going to give and that isn't even all the drama around them.  With the family arc that is on vacation there, secrets are uncovered all around. You see mistakes with them such as being that they are ""wealthy"", why didn't they get their son a room of his own?!?! There are a few more holes with them too but it doesn't matter as they are just dysfunctional to the core.  With the heiress who is almost off her rocker thanks to her relationship with her late mom, its interesting to get into her neurosis while she's on this vacation. And she has tons and tons of neurosis.  The staff, oh goodness - the staff is pulled into the vacationers dramas and their own dramas. No spoilers here, ya got to see how messed up they are to believe.  For me, this show is that 'other side' glimpse of ""vacations are nice, but you still take whatever was going on with you before with you there"". Not everyone who goes on vacation, just these folks. And probably after.",10,positive

What they all have in common is extremely unlikeable characters (without a single exception) and an unbelievably slow pace. The show runner seemingly mistakes extreme decadence for humor. OK, there was some dark humor in the first two series, but in series three there is none. And no thrills, either. Just severe overacting (especially by Parker Posey), and the most annoying (and overly loud & overly dramatic) soundtrack I have ever heard in all my life. If this is typical Thai music, I feel sorry for the Thai people. Wouldn't go there if someone paid me...",3,negative
Great movie and would rewatch it. It was a kot kf fun to watch. Not only were there things to relate to but it was funny as well. It gave a very nostalgic feel to it and it was like modern day addams family. I loved all the actors they used. I believe they did a good job. I binged this and watched it quickly. I loved how smart and witty Wednesday is and it was simply a fun ride. I have it set to watch again. I have recommended the show to many friends and family and they all love it. So i will continue to pass thr message on that everyone neeeds to watch it. From new younger people to older people who want to remember the good ol days. Fun!!,9,positive
"I was not familiar w/ this series before the show was aired. At first I was quite confused it took me a couple of episodes to understand that they were jumping timelines. However, for the most part I really did enjoy the show. I ended up rewatching the show again this week (first watched it when it aired in 2019) and ive got to say that I caught on to a lot more details/plot points the 2nd time around as I understood the timelines. Definitely recommend",6,neutral
"I'm new to the history of Adams family.  This is a fun, thrilling drama with a mixed of Nancy Drew and Harry Potter feel.. The huge castle is lovely, Ms Jenna added so much spice as Wednesday.  With Vampires, werewolves and sirens in that school fighting magic. Season 2 can add that much more suspense and depth with writers. Viewers will love its flow and vibe. Jenna dance sequence was a lovely job by the director. Enjoy it. Season 1 was short but it opens up that much more with characters. I did wish Mr and Mrs Adams were younger in the casting like in their 30s. But Ms Jenna steals the show....",10,positive
The show is captivating and all the actors are perfect in each role they play Bravo !!!,10,positive
"This show is by far one of the best Netflix has released in the past years. It certainly is my new favorite show! The characters are perfect, the acting is great and the storyline is entertaining and mystical. The CGI of the monster could have been better but it does suit the theme. The villain arc was predictable but still an absolute 10/10. Jenna played Wednesday insanely good and Enid, in my opinion, deserves even more screen time in season 2! Enid is just as interesting of a character as Wednesday is - great writers and show producers. The suspense is killing me indeed. Can't wait for season 2.",10,positive
This show is not for the squeamish. Will be disturbing for many. Often violent and a lot of animal slaughter. I was waiting to see a note that no animal cruelty was used but they did not post anything. I found the story line about this very dysfunctional family to be very real and absorbing. The scenery is amazing. If you like a gritty western this is it. I liked it and will be watching S3.,10,positive
"I have read every book in order and the first killing floor is one of the best. This tv series really captures the books quality. Great acting, script and direction. Can not wait for next season.",6,neutral
"I first saw this on HBO max and thought to myself ""this might not be good, but i'll try this show out anyways"".  Turns out I have been binge watching this gem of a tv show. I enjoy it a lot, also it seems a bit different from most shows which is refreshing.  There is some good humor, and serious scenes which I also really enjoy. I am not done watching yet, but I am more than pleased with what this show has to offer.  If you have time then give this show a try- this will not leave you disappointed and hopefully it will be refreshing to you as well. The scenes have been aesthetically pleasurable too!",8,positive
"It's a great escape of reality and a perfect show to start binge-watching. It took me a few episodes to really get to love the show, but with each episode I grew more and more fun of their way of telling the story. Henry Cavill does an amazing job and I cannot wait to see what's more to come in the world of the Witcher.",3,negative
"Found it! This is the BEST program that i have ever seen! Acting, casting, scenery, animals, cowboys & girls/ drama/ love/ hate/ loyalty and i could go on.  Its everything, i love watching it and i hope it doesn't go away for a long time. If you've not already started it, well.... Im jealous that you get to see it for the first time again. Its incredible.  Thank you Taylor Sheridan, Kevin Costner and every other person that brings this show to life. You all do an amazing job. Please don't stop.",9,positive
"I never give a ten unless it is blinding so a 9 is excellent but not astounding.  The Blinders really took me to the grit and dirt of post WW1 Britain, it is atmospheric and draws you into the time. It was actually bit of an education of how people lived.  The plot is complex and mysterious and you find yourself trying to guess what will happen next.  There is a fantastic underlying romance cracking on.  There are a good few sub plots spinning about to keep you amused and entertained; a few laughs and feel good moments; a few tragedies to keep you depressed if that's what your into.  I started to relate to the characters quite early on and they are all distinctive. You really feel involved from the start unless you have no social skills.  All in all a good watch, I was waiting for it to come on the next week ... not literally obviously ... I didn't like sit in my flat for a week looking at a blank screen till it came on, but I did look forward to seeing the next episode.  You certainly won't waste your time having a gander!",6,neutral
"I love sci-fi and stories about a dystopian future, but this show just isn't very good.  I don't think I'm saying anything groundbreaking here, but if you are a writer creating a brand new fantasy or sci-fi universe, it's the little details that matter. If you leave them out, your world will appear lifeless and the reader or viewer won't feel that it's real, breaking the immersion. We see very little of this world to begin with and what we do see doesn't really make any sense, making it a huge nonsense, even if you're trying to symphatize with the story and the protagonist.  It also doesn't help if you're trying to inflate a short novel into several seasons without any interesting ideas. It's so slow that you can practically do your chores while watching it, I guarantee you're not going to miss anything even if you take a peek at the screen once every 5 minutes. I could only get through 4 episodes and eventually started working instead, that makes a lot more sense than wasting my time on a story that goes nowhere.  My third big problem with the show is the main actress (coincidentally also one of the producers), who doesn't really fit this role and is genuinely unlikeable. I don't really get her characters' motivations either, her actions seem to be all over the place and it's extremely confusing. Of course, this could all be on purpose, but shouldn't there be at least one person in the story you can identify with or root for?",10,positive
"This show fits Kevin Costner like a glove, he plays the perfect cowboy/ranch owner!  It's a modern days cowboys & Indians with grit!",10,positive
"This show is one of the most interscope shows i've very watched. if your looking for a show that takes you back to the old times but also brings you to the future at the same time, this is your show to watch. it is the perfect amount of thrill sadness and some happiness. something new is happening at every turn and you will always be on your toes.",10,positive
"Never thought i was going to like it. After 30 minutes of first episode i waa getting bored. But by start of episode 3 it had me interested, by end of same episode i was hooked. Good acting, good drama, great action scenes and lovely scenery. Im defo a fan of this now.",8,positive
"I wouldn't call myself a big Star Wars fan, I have seen some of the movies but not all of them. However I enjoyed this show and find myself wanting to know more about the Star Wars universe.  Each episode is exciting and I haven't come across one I didn't like. This first season would be 10 from me if the episodes were longer. I think they are too short as most tv shows run for 45-60min episodes. For this reason I give it a 9.",10,positive
"Not a huge fan of Andor Season 1. I'm probably in the minority but it wasn't my cup of tea. Much like I didn't love Rogue One as much as everyone else either. It felt like every week nothing was happening and wasn't progressing at all just characters going places and talking, some of the political bits were interesting. Maybe season 2 will change my mind. Episode 8 was the best and one I actually genuinely enjoyed as to watch Andor and Andy Serkis's character develop in an amazing way to end in an emotional ending. Seeing everyone rise up from the prison was great to watch and made for some amazing action sequences and espionage moments. I don't think anything was wrong with the show maybe the pacing was too slow and it dragged out too long but most of all wasn't for me.",6,neutral
"I actually didn't have any expectations, just because usually when this much people rave about something it's just over hipped, but this is really good. I loved the acting and the camera angles, just perfect!",9,positive
"This TV show is really good, however I think more than 3 seasons of this show was enough, after that I personally think it dragged on and I got bored. So I think it should have been a mini series. The whole concept was a really good idea as I think it has a really good meaning behind it and also what what society could eventually be like. Parts of it were slow but in my opinion that is what gives good detail. The main character could sometimes be annoying but over all this tv show was quite good. For this reason it's 7/10.",7,neutral
"The Last of Us is a masterful television adaptation of the beloved video game that delivers a gripping and deeply emotional experience. The series follows Joel, a hardened survivor navigating a brutal post-apocalyptic world ravaged by a fungal infection, and Ellie, a resilient young girl who may be humanity's last hope. Together, their journey explores themes of survival, trust, and the complex bonds that form in desperate times.  The acting throughout the series is exceptional. Pedro Pascal brings a raw intensity and vulnerability to Joel, perfectly capturing the character's gruff exterior and hidden depth. Bella Ramsey's portrayal of Ellie is equally impressive, embodying a mix of toughness, curiosity, and emotional complexity that makes her character truly memorable. The chemistry between the two leads is electric and forms the emotional core of the show, grounding the larger story in their relationship.  Visually, The Last of Us is stunning, painting a post-apocalyptic landscape that is both haunting and beautiful. The cinematography captures the stark contrasts between desolation and fleeting moments of hope, while the special effects and production design create a world that feels immersive and believable. Every frame reflects the care and detail invested in bringing this world to life.  While the series does take some creative liberties with the source material, it does so thoughtfully. The changes made are designed to deepen character development and enhance the narrative, rather than merely replicate the game's storyline. This fresh perspective allows the show to stand on its own merits, appealing to longtime fans and newcomers alike.  Ultimately, The Last of Us is a must-watch television series that brilliantly balances tension, emotion, and storytelling. It captures the heart and spirit of the original game while elevating the material through powerful performances and cinematic craftsmanship. Whether you're familiar with the game or discovering this story for the first time, the series offers a compelling and unforgettable journey.",7,neutral
This was great. It brought the world to life without betraying the stories on the page.,10,positive
"I didn't even expect the story line and making would be that good.  Faultless, incredible making & experienced actor/actress completes to excellent finishes.",9,positive
"Never read the books but i would like to see a full series based on the books and to continue just like that, simple yet funny, smart and humane.  It was fun and the characters's chemistry was there. I prefer 8 ep of 50 min and to just make me binge watch the whole thing in one sitting that to skip half the ep because its boring and too long.  Even though it was the first time to watch Alan as Jack i think that based on the discruption they did a really good job finding someone very similar.",10,positive
The long awaited start of season 2 definitely did not disappoint this viewer. The first season was great. Each member of the family has their own story. The daughter is absolutely a great asset to the plot. Jemey is still developing as a character and I am looking forward to see where he lands in the scheme of things.,10,positive
This is what we've all been waiting for. The ultimate Bounty Hunter series.  First episode sent chills down my spine and hype into my stomach. This is going to be a good month.,8,positive
"I have watched and enjoyed Yellowstone from the first episode regardless that scripts and characters can seem disjointed at times. I was still in ""can't wait to get to the next episode"" mode, until they introduced Jimmy. Neither his character or storyline add anything to the production, so much so that I actually began fast forwarding through his scenes. He is painfully unattractive, so connecting his character to two good looking women felt in authentic and unrealistic. I was elated at the end of season four when he decided to go back to Texas, and can only hope he stays there!",10,positive
Great role for Kevin Costner. Good story line and acting can't wait to see what happens next.,10,positive
"This is not just for this episode, but for the whole series. It was amazing from the start but wow how it gets better each episode. This is the best Sci-fi series I have ever seen, beats even Star Trek. My goodness. When the whole series is done I'm gonna binge watch it again!",10,positive
